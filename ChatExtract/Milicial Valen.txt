: Gruumsh Boon - Pendent in the shape of a single eye

Gruumsh (pronounced: /gruːmʃ/ groomsh[23] or: /grʌmʃ/ grumsh[23]) was the patron god of the orc race and greater god of the orc pantheon.[10] He was named He Who Never Sleeps for he was said to never tire,[24] and symbolized with an ever-open eye to represent the orc belief that he watched over them all.

This "open eye pendant" pendant allows the wearer to achieve a long rest once with only 4 hours of light activity at which time the eye closes for 24 hours as it slowly opens and is fully opened and recharged at the end of the 24 hours.

: In Malicias culture giving rings to others is a sign of submissions and subordinance, as if a soldier pledging their fealty to a king or "Superior Officer" to aid in showing ones standing and rank as with military insignia. The more rings one wears symbolizes the more forces one controls The more ornate the ring the higher the standing the giver sees the receiver.

Where as gifting bracelets is a sign of gratitude, respect, and loyalty.

It is also worth noting that earrings gifted to other show a sign of trust or familial bond.

In stark contrast necklaces don't really mean anything and are usually something individuals get for them selves as a display of personal beliefs or lack there of.

[11:14 PM]DJDuwies: The Valen family had been The Dimension Caretakers for 2 centuries. The founder of the family was  Kaelan Ironheart Valen < human>, a stead fast protector who stood against the darkeness of the gates of the outer planes trying to merge.  He was hailed as a hero of the realm. He found his life mate and wife < Aeress Ezzie, Aasimar> within the Excelsior gate-town which lead to Mount Celestia. Aeress helped the desidens accept this new group who were looking to help keep the peace.  Decades went by with no noticable issues of rumbles from the Gates. 
     Torin Wildheaart, human, took over the position for his brother after a Quinquagenarian. Torin was a daring rogue who took to the thrills of going into the gates and checking on the leaders and standings of the different portal worlds. Even with the evil edge to those in Torch , which is connected to Gehenna, Torin found his mate, Zynga Urolo , a pink tiefling with yellow long hair braided down her back. Torin was more concerned with the evil contentment of the choas realms. He appeased the dark realms  with deep sacrifies and treasures beyond compare. The gate Torin choose to ignore was Hopeless the gate to Hades. The leaders killed him and left him as an example to the Valen family that no one could control the gates and no one could control the chaos. The hearts of the family shattered with loss.

[11:14 PM]DJDuwies: After the reign of Torin, his sisters Zahra and Zahira were the only ones who had faith to take on the role as leaders of the Dimesion Caretakers. Now feeling that effecting the different worlds was wrong, they became watchers allowing the ebb and flow of the chaos right itself as the decades passed. Zahra was the collector of knowledge, trusting Zahira to be her eyes and ears. Twice a year the met to complete the journals of the Outlands. Keeping the knowledge within the family, created several homes and libraries. Each journal kept notes of those who lead, wars, discontent, and wins. 
    Zahra and Zahira made rules to follow for the family.

[2:07 AM]DJDuwies: Kiss from suki
[11:53 PM]DJDuwies: The morning before the party took the portal Melicia thinks on all that has happened to her since meeting her new friends.  She stood in the exercise field in a shirt and pants and practices every move she could remember from her training with her dad and her many instructors. She closed her eyes picturing a different field.

Parry, Slash, Block, Lunge, Kick, Roll, Slice, Parry, Parry, Twist.

Picturing Mea on the step waiting for her to finish her last test against their toughest instructor and begin her first mission as an actual official member of the Valen family Group. Melicia passed with a bow from her instructor and a giant hug from Mea. The party they enjoyed with the refugees was amazing. The games, the meal, the dancing, and the company. The refugees were a mix of many different races.  Mea and Melicia were swapped as dance partners until the fires ran low. You took joy where you could and remembered home is where you could find happiness.

[11:54 PM]DJDuwies: That night was the brightest night Melicia could remember at the Valen Home. The Shields were still up and guards posted but it didn't stop the attack, that took over a fifth of the refugees and really made the Valen Family Mission hit home for Melicia. Melicia and Mea were sent to protect the children . Her friends will never need to know how quickly she failed after becoming part of the Valen Group. The scar on her right side will always remind her.

Stab, Parry, Riposte, Deflect, Feint, Slash, Chop, Push, Jump Back, Barrel Roll, Slice

She and Mea fought off a dozen, one of whom shot some sort of shot at Melicia. Melicia dodged out of the way, at the expense of a small refugee child. The fight continued with Melicia and Mea defending the children. Time pasted in a terrible blur of metal and sweat. A high screeching sound stopped the battle and the enemies seemed to vanish as they always did. When Mea and Melicia turned to look at the children Melicia finally saw where the shot went that she dodged. The little boy was against the wall, his right arm and part of his small chest gone. He was gone. 

Mea was off looking after others while Melicia was cradling this poor child in her arms. This was her fault. If she had done better at keep the enemy back, at topping the attack. No! "Shaundakul!" She begged. "It was not his time. This is not his fight! Give me the strength to help this poor soul! " She felt healing magic flow thru her body to the broken body in her arms. His chest healed and with the surge of power flowing thru her his arm grew back pink and raw but whole .

Father- Ollie Tristan < The Veiled Custodian >

1-Milicia <Self/She/her> paladin/ cleric 
Milicia Valen born to Ollie Valen and Constance  OrbShadow  Valen. She is the youngest of seven children . Being the oldest of seven meant being a hassle, being underfoot and always feeling like she was in the way, especially after her mom disappeared. Milicia knew her family was important growing up with stories of demons , angels, magic, treasure, sacrifice, betrayal and love. 

The oldest child Maxwell , a tall, strong, long dark hard and eyes. Being twelve years her senior, he taught her how to  fight with a sword, defend herself, sleep with a dagger under her pillow. She definitely had to learn to sew as well after ruining enough pillows from the Valen home. Maxwell also taught Milicia how to let the small things go. 
[8:22 PM]Duwies: Maggie <Magdalena Spencer> and her identical twin Maddison terroized Milicia. Milicia was the youngest, took the longest to get hair, the darkest green, weakest, and most uselesss in the family. Being the oldest girls they already had every advantage but it was helped by being beautiful very close to human and very dangerous. They worked perfectly together as a team to handle and complete any task or mission they were given. 
Maximilian didn't trust Milicia with anything because she was so small and extra when they were all growing up. She did get to learn fighting and defense from Maximilian, mostly due to the fights they tended to have with each other. Even with her brother being so much stronger she was fast. She learned how to avoid attacks and strike fast. Her favorite move against Maximilian being striking hard at his Achilles heels.
[1:38 AM]Duwies: •    Maggie and Maddison ————-Race/Heritage: Human with a trace of orc lineage, giving her a subtly exotic and powerful presence. Her features lean mostly human, but the orcish heritage shows in sharper canines, slightly stronger brow structure, and a faint green undertone to her skin that’s only noticeable in certain light.
    •    Age: 35 years old, mature and confident. Being one of a set of twins, she carries a mirrored bond with her sibling, reflected in their shared expressions and postures.
    •    Physique: Tall, athletic, and undeniably strong. Her musculature is pronounced but not bulky — she has the grace of a seasoned warrior combined with the endurance of someone who’s lived a life of physical discipline. Her strength is matched by elegance, making her presence both commanding and beautiful.
    •    Appearance:
    •    Hair: Long, thick, and striking — either jet black with a natural sheen, or streaked with silver at the edges, symbolizing her wisdom and years of battle. Often worn in braids or half loose, practical yet beautiful.
