## “Seraphia, The Ethereal Kingdom” by Elara Dawn

This story beckons readers into a realm born from the ashes of cosmic conflict, where "The First One," a believed-deceased benevolent creator god, orchestrates a quiet resurgence after a clash with the 12 rebellious ancient gods. Across the eons, and veiled from time's grasp, "The First One" clandestinely selects willing individuals from a myriad of dimensions and realities to populate Seraphia, a pocket dimension outside the bounds of conventional time, space, and existence. This pristine sanctuary, shielded from the gaze of the 12 rebellious gods, emerges as a testament to artful curation—a society of elevated beings blissfully unaware of their tumultuous origins, which have been forgotten over the passage of time.

As the saga unfolds within this ethereal kingdom, readers bear witness to a paradise where the carefully chosen inhabitants dwell in idyllic harmony, unknowing of the cosmic upheaval that birthed their tranquil abode. The veil of histories past shrouds Seraphia, a realm where peace and serenity reign supreme, preserving the delicate balance crafted by "The First One" in the absence of the 12 rebellious ancient gods' interference. Dawn's narrative intricately intertwines "The First One’s” divine craftsmanship, cosmic secrets, and the enduring legacy of a creator believed to be lost to time, inviting readers to explore a world where beauty and turmoil converge in the creation of exquisite harmony.

## “In The Beginning” by The Fabled Press

The kingdom of Seraphia is both ancient and futuristic, existing outside of normal time and space. It is separate and unique in its own pocket dimension, which no one other than “The First One” can allow entrance to or exit from. Both the kingdom and the dimension itself are known as Seraphia. Seraphia the dimension was created as the result of a cataclysmic battle between “The First One,” a benevolent creator god, and 12 younger but still ancient gods who grew bored of the peace and prosperity “The First One” strove to create. The ensuing battle ripped a hole in existence itself, creating the dimension of Seraphia, which “The First One” then escaped into and sealed behind him, causing the 12 to believe he had been destroyed.

“The First One” spent eons recovering their power and creating Seraphia, the kingdom. Towards the end, they carefully cultivated beings from all of the rest of existence, making sure not to alert the 12 of their presence. “The First One” made sure to only choose those worthy and willing, cultivating a perfect, peaceful new society composed of the best of the best.

One of the first citizens of Seraphia was the younger god known as Ceridwen, a goddess of wisdom and learning. Her holy library, “The Library of Ascendia,” is rumored to contain all of the written, living worlds’ knowledge as well as a great deal beyond that. It is said her thirst for knowledge is never ending and she continues to seek every morsel of it that she can. Though she cannot directly impact the lives of mortals due to a curse placed on her by the 12, she is still able to grant knowledge through her immense library.

After centuries of growth, evolution, and interspecies mingling, the people of the kingdom of Seraphia physically became almost indistinguishable from typical humans. This process happened slowly over the centuries and is simply how the people are, with no remembrance of their former physical species’ differences, though some still have very minor traits—like elves’ descendants having slightly elongated ears or dragon descendants having tiny scales around their eyes.

## “The Ancient Chronicles of Mogo: A Treatise on the Catians”

**Translated from the Original Text by the Scribes of the Laplahn Valley**

### Volume I: The Rise and Fall of the Catians

In the early days of Mogo, when the planet was still in its formative stages, the Catians emerged as one of the first intelligent species to inhabit this world. These towering beings, with their sleek coats and piercing eyes, roamed the planet's surface, leaving a trail of wonder and awe in their wake.

#### The Early Years
The Catians were known for their laziness, often sleeping for extended periods—sometimes up to two months at a time. During these periods of dormancy, their bodies would undergo a process of rejuvenation, allowing them to maintain their incredible size and strength. Despite their massive stature, the Catians were peaceful by nature, with a deep connection to the planet's energy.

#### The Great Migrations
As the ages passed, the Catians continued to roam the planet, their migrations causing destruction and chaos wherever they went. Their massive bodies would often inadvertently knock over mountains and disrupt the natural balance of the planet's ecosystems.

#### The Devastation of the Glimmerbirds
One of the earliest recorded incidents of the Catians' destructive power occurred during their migration to the northern pole. As they traversed the Forest of Jurad, they inadvertently knocked over a mountain range, causing a catastrophic earthquake that destroyed the Glimmerbirds' cities. The Glimmerbirds, with their iridescent wings and shimmering cities, were a species that lived in harmony with the planet's energy. Their civilization was lost forever, a testament to the unintended consequences of the Catians' actions.

#### The Legacy of the Catians
Today, the Catians continue to roam the planet, their massive bodies a reminder of the destructive power that lies within. Their migrations are still a spectacle to behold, and their connection to the planet's energy remains a source of wonder and awe. Despite the devastation they have caused, the Catians remain a beloved and integral part of Mogo.

## “Micio the Magical Mouse” (Children’s Storybook, Found on Mogo)

In the land of Mogo, where the sun shines bright and the creatures roam free, there lived a tiny mouse named Micio. Micio was no ordinary mouse, for he possessed a special gift – the power of magic.

Micio lived in a cozy little hole in the wall of a great, ancient city, where the Brobdingnagians once dwelled. He spent his days exploring the ruins, marveling at the strange, glowing symbols etched into the walls.

One day, as Micio was out on a stroll, he stumbled upon a massive, sleeping Catian. The Catian, whose name was Whiskers, was so big that Micio looked like a tiny ant compared to her. Whiskers was known throughout the land for her laziness, but also for her kindness. However, her massive size and strength made her a force to be reckoned with.

Micio, feeling brave, decided to climb up Whiskers' fur and reach the highest point on her head. As he climbed, he noticed that Whiskers was starting to stir. The Catian stretched her massive body, causing the ground to shake and tremble.

Micio, realizing his mistake, quickly cast a spell to calm Whiskers down. But, to his surprise, his magic had an unexpected effect – it made Whiskers start to dance! The Catian's massive body began to sway and swing, causing the earth to shake and the skies to rumble.

The people of Mogo, who had been watching from a distance, cheered and clapped at the sight of the dancing Catian. Micio, feeling proud of himself, continued to cast his spells, making Whiskers dance even more wildly.

But, as the dance reached its climax, Whiskers' massive body began to glow with an otherworldly energy. The energy grew brighter and brighter, until it exploded in a blast of light and sound that shook the very foundations of the planet.

When the dust settled, Whiskers lay still, her body charred and still. Micio, realizing what he had done, felt a pang of guilt. He had never meant to harm the Catian, but his magic had gotten out of control.

The people of Mogo, who had gathered to watch the spectacle, cheered and clapped for Micio, hailing him as a hero. And from that day on, Micio was known as the Magical Mouse, the bravest and most clever mouse in all the land.

But, as the years passed, the story of Micio's bravery was forgotten, and the Catians continued to roam the planet, causing destruction and chaos wherever they went. And Micio, realizing that his magic was not enough to stop the Catians, knew that he had to find a new way to defeat them.

And so, Micio set out on a quest to find the secret of the Catians' weakness, and to use his magic to defeat them. But, alas, his quest was doomed to fail, for the Catians were too powerful, and Micio's magic was too weak.

But, Micio's bravery and cunning ultimately led to the downfall of many of the most dangerous Catians, and the rise of a new era of peace and prosperity in the land of Mogo. And Micio, the Magical Mouse, was hailed as a hero, his name etched into the annals of history.
