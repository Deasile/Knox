[2:25 AM]William J: As well as me being aware of more than they remember you telling us above table
[2:25 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: what happens here (Milicias home)..... could DRACTICLY change the course of events!!!!!!
[2:25 AM]William J: I know tons that they were told and forgot
[2:25 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: oh yea
[2:26 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: i can 100% gurentee that
[2:26 AM]William J: And why were these people being hunted by the 12........ No.... These fucks are from another realm that was destroyed. Aren't they?
[2:27 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: the 12 who is that?
[2:27 AM]William J: Refugees "fucks"
[2:27 AM]William J: The 11
[2:27 AM]William J: ?
[2:27 AM]William J: Am I high
[2:27 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: i'm not sure who this cult of the 12 you speak of even is
[2:27 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: .... üôÇ
[2:27 AM]William J: WOOOOW
[2:28 AM]William J: Wait..... What is the main deity of the prime material plane now?
[2:28 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: are they some kind of religious group maybe?
[2:29 AM]William J: Lmao
[2:29 AM]William J: Dick
[2:29 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: what do you mean main deity, different people worship different gods raised on any number of factors ( more typical DnD  Deity interactions) 
[2:30 AM]William J: How did that even work that way? Were the 12 NOT on his side?
[2:30 AM]William J: Stop fkn with me for one seec
[2:30 AM]William J: Sec*
[2:31 AM]William J: Brain twisted a piece of information I think
[2:31 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: yea.. but he didn't want to be the "one true" or "top" god ... he just wanted Eldricuses influence gone
[2:31 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: and Eldricus dead
[2:32 AM]William J: I don't understand the motive there... But, it's godly disputes
[2:32 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: they are diametrically apposed forces  mater / antimater.... order/ chaos
[2:33 AM]William J: Just a certain opposing entity existing could cause a similar situation.... Good point
[2:33 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: and during their lives in the Golden City .. Eldricus always made Sucirdel feel unwanted un needed worthless
[2:34 AM]William J: But you need both to create balance. Surcidahl fucked up the natural order BAAAD. I can't wait to see how bad
[2:34 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: and the worst part ... not even intentionally
[2:34 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: did he... or did he .... step aside and create a ... different balance
[2:35 AM]William J: Yea... Eldricus was just being a god with a personality. No spite intended anywhere
[2:35 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: after he got his vengeance
[2:36 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: also most gods dont.... die permanently 
[2:38 AM]William J: I feel like Eldricus is gonezo because surcidahl locked him in timeout for a lot longer than 1k years
[2:38 AM]William J: Assumption
[2:38 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: but.... fortunately....... some one......... released and even more powerful balancing duo ... who Don't have beef üòõ 
[2:39 AM]William J: Yaaaaaaaaay!!!!!!
[2:39 AM]William J: Dax happy dance.
[2:39 AM]William J:

[2:40 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: ....... pats on the head... good boy dax you prevented ALLLLL of existence from .... blinking out of "existence" ... restarting EVEVERY thing from 0
[2:41 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: ... leaving only the one... above all others..... primordial being to restart everything and once again forget who she is
[2:42 AM]William J: Feren has done soo many "small things"  (in his opinion) that I'm amazed I dont let it get to his head.
[2:42 AM]William J: ,............................................
[2:43 AM]William J: I knew Tsuki was the best
[2:43 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: üòõ

[2:44 AM]William J: Makes sense why you denied her as a patron so quickly
[2:44 AM]William J: .......
[2:44 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: Lolol
[2:45 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: I was happy to give her to the noobie.. because... plot and noobie.. and ... stuff
[2:46 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: .. ya know great old one... etc etc
[2:49 AM]William J: I'm torn. Because you would think that she at least is AWARE of Dax getting her out of limbo..... And even IF it didn't matter. The effort was made by a mortal, for no selfish reasons.
[2:50 AM]William J: I hoped for a little more interaction. Not appreciation. Interaction
[2:51 AM]William J: It's like.... The scope of the situation vs. The miniscule effect most mortal beings have on gods.
[2:52 AM]William J: At least some "acknowledgment" after she was more.... Herself.
[2:52 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: You.. prevented the inevitable destruction and rebirth of EVERYTHING that has happened more times than anyone knows... what happens next... no one knows.. as the players embark on a new path never before having happened a new excited unimaginable story... the fate of all existence now delicately lays solely at the behest of the party 
[2:53 AM]William J: I understand fully
[2:55 AM]William J: I was just saying, I did get the satisfaction of getting her OUT of purgatory.... As a player however, I was waiting for her to become aware enough to give a proper thank you.... And not like that either.
[2:55 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: Im going to workshop that and post it in the campaign notes soon
[2:55 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: Welcome to the preview
[2:55 AM]William J: Sounds good

[2:56 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: Probably add something like... your true adventure starts NOW
[2:57 AM]William J: Can't believe the world didn't reset because of Feren.....
[2:57 AM]Deasile[OBEY]

[2:58 AM]Deasile[OBEY]

[2:59 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: Noo even he goes bye bye
[2:59 AM]William J: Oh... Neat
[2:59 AM]William J: What was initially planned
[2:59 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: Everyone and everything except Tsuki... goes poof.. and Tsuki... restarts the entire shabang
[3:00 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: Then forgets who she is
[3:00 AM]William J: I swear to.....Tsuki?.... I'm gonna find her again!
[3:01 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: rince repeat... until you find that one puzzle piece that can change the fate of.. well everything
[3:01 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: the urn....
[3:01 AM]William J: Nailed it!
[3:01 AM]Deasile[OBEY]

[3:03 AM]William J: Hell yea!
[3:03 AM]William J: Dax Is KILLING it
[3:04 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: refugees? what refugees? you mean the settlers? from Milicias home? 
[3:04 AM]William J: Ok. So that IS what you were getting at.
[3:04 AM]William J: Duwies is gonna fucking kill you..... Good luck with that
[3:05 AM]Deasile[OBEY]

[3:06 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: Tsuki is the MOTHER/FATHER... rebirther of all existence.. was that not clear
[3:08 AM]William J: Yes it was. BUT, WILL is arguing semantics and genetics because reasons....
[3:08 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: lol ...
[3:08 AM]William J: Lmao
[3:08 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: she is the one who helped fate put the "players" on the path to changing things üòõ
[3:09 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: she is the one who put plans in motion for Alabol to be your Patrion and Milicias god to be her gods, and the book to be in your moms posesion ..
[3:10 AM]William J: Ok. Enough for now. Dax really wanted to give Tsuki a hug. But now I don't think he deserves to be in her grace lol lolololol
[3:11 AM]Deasile[OBEY]
: the weaver of the tapestries, of fate its self, to prevent the same things from happening over and over for all eternity
