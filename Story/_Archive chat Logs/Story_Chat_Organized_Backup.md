## Gods & Cosmic Balance

- [2:31 AM] DM: Yea.. but he didn't want to be the "one true" or "top" god ... he just wanted Eldricuses influence gone
- [2:31 AM] DM: and Eldricus dead
- [2:32 AM] Player: I don't understand the motive there... But, it's godly disputes
- [2:32 AM] DM: they are diametrically apposed forces  mater / antimater.... order/ chaos
- [2:34 AM] DM: and during their lives in the Golden City .. Eldricus always made Sucirdel feel unwanted un needed worthless
- [2:34 AM] DM: and the worst part ... not even intentionaly

- [2:35 AM] Player: But you need both to create balance. Surcidahl messed up the natural order badly. I can't wait to see how bad
- - [2:34 AM] DM: did he... or did he .... step aside and create a ... different balance
- [2:35 AM] DM: after he got his vengence
- [2:36 AM] DM: also most gods dont.... die permanently 
- [2:38 AM] Player: I feel like Eldricus is gonezo because surcidahl locked him in timeout for a lot longer than 1k years (Speculation)
>Above speculation Could be used for story naritive question is he gone it seems like it might be or maybe just for a realy extra long time who knows
- [2:38 AM] DM: but.... fortunatly....... some one......... released and even more powerful balancing duo ... who Don't have beef 
>Above references the Priestess of the sun and the Priestess of the Moon which the party freed ( mostly just dax) 
- [2:52 AM] DM: You.. prevented the inevitable destruction and rebirth of EVERYTHING that has happened more times than anyone knows... what happens next... no one knows.. as the players embark on a new path never before having happened a new excited unimaginable story... the fate of all existence now delicately lays solely at the behest of the party 
>The above is a potential phrasing for a closing, or final post, statment for the begining of this "new chapter" in the story

## Tsukiâ€™s Role & Lore

-
- [2:43 AM] Player: I knew Tsuki was the best
>above is the player realising just how important and powerful Tsuki is
- 
- [2:49 AM] Player: I'm torn. Because you would think that she at least is AWARE of Dax getting her out of limbo..... And even IF it didn't matter. The effort was made by a mortal, for no selfish reasons. (Speculation)
> Above the player speculating that by the partys action ( mostly dax) the he hops dax has earned some meaning full importance to Tsuki and posibly seeing her again   
- [2:50 AM] Player: I hoped for a little more interaction. Not appreciation. Interaction (Speculation)
>Above same as the previous "above elaboration"
- [2:52 AM] Player: At least some "acknowledgment" after she was more.... Herself. (Speculation)
>Above same as the previous "above elaboration"
- [2:55 AM] DM: Im going to workshop that and post it in the campaign notes soon
- [3:03 AM] DM: the Sun and Moon priestesses' are her .. first children
- >Above this referes to Tsuki being the mother 
- [3:06 AM] DM: Tsuki is the MOTHER/FATHER... rebirther of all existance.. was that not clear
- [3:08 AM] DM: she (Tsuki) is the one who helped fate put the "players" on the path to changing things
- [3:09 AM] DM: she (Tsuki) is the one who put plans in motion for Alabol to be your Patron and Milicias god to be her gods, and the book to be in your moms possession ..
- [3:11 AM] DM: (Again Tsuki) the weaver of the tapestries, of fate itself, to prevent the same things from happening over and over for all eternity

## Party Actions & Consequences

- [2:40 AM] DM: dax you (and the party, kind of but we don't need to be mean) prevented ALLLLL of existence from .... blinking out of "existence" ... restarting EVERYTHING from 0
- [2:42 AM] Player: Feren Dax has done soo many "small things"  (in his opinion) that I'm amazed I dont let it get to his head.
- [2:57 AM] DM: I was fully ready to restart at the moment the party ran into dax....
- >Above references when the party first met Dax on the planet Mogo ( a living god planet) in the realm of souls aka where the sould of the dead go to be cleaned striped of memories and experance in preperation to be reborn, the information isn't lost but the experences and knowledge rejoins and becomes part of Mogo  ( i never really named the realm some help please?)
- [2:58 AM] Player: As in. Plan in motion for sucksonnuts(refering to Sucirdle )  to remake everything HIS way. (Speculation)
>Above is inacurate speculation in truth as stated elsewhere at the moment ((he (Sucirdle) didn't want to be the "one true" or "top" god ... he (Sucirdle) just wanted Eldricuses influence gone))
- [2:59 AM] DM: Everyone and everything except Tsuki... goes poof.. and Tsuki... restarts the entire shabang
- >Above if the Urn, containing the Priestess of the sun and the Priestess of the Moon wasent found, and opened BEFORE Garamith aka The Old Man	who is a Minor Bad Guy, and part of a much larger story arch not covered hear in but should be mentioned, Garamith is one posible cause of the end of all existence by opening the urn and useing the gene wish to curupt and tainting the Priestess of the sun and the Priestess of the Moon after opening it which then leads to the utter oblitoration of all existance except for Tsuki the mother of all creation


- 
- [3:03 AM] Player: Where the hell are we gonna bring the refugees now?!
    [3:04 AM] DM: refugees? what refugees? you mean the settlers? from Milicias home? 
    >Above during the course of this first part of the adventure some extream changes have been made that has altered time space and even the very physical manifestation of the order of time through thing increadably "out of wack" and into an uncertin chaotic mess, that the players are now just starting their adventure to figure out what is going on, is it related to something else? some one else? is it related to the destruction of the Pocket dimention also called The kingdom of Seraphia, and once upon a time long ago before the gods of the mortal relms existed called the golden city.... anyway the refugees are no longer reffugees, they are simple settlers, there hasn't been any real trouble for some time ( in the perspective of these people) and the settlers are infact part of the Gate Wardens recruitment peoples ( please find a better way to word that)  

- [3:14 AM] DM: he, (dax, but we dont need to rub that in when crafting the story) became the SINGLE lynch pin.... ooh and that was never planned,,, WILL (the player of dax) made Dax step face first into it all on his own, refering to the fact that i didn't have any guidence or hand in pushing him that way he did it all on his own recognicence 
- [3:15 AM] DM: i was fully expecting at least 3 resets before the party picked up on things, until YOU ... until Dax came along, and gave me hope
- >Above this was my initial "guestimation" on how many times Tsuki the mother of all creation, would have had to reset all of existence before the players got it right or at least caught on in order to get it right, if you can use this in the naritive please do

## Refugees, Resets, and World Events

- [2:26 AM] Player: And why were these people being hunted by the 12........ No.... These are from another realm that was destroyed. Aren't they? (Speculation)

- [3:04 AM] DM: refugees? what refugees? you mean the settlers? from Milicias home? ( check other references to combine)
- >Above referenced else where weird stuff happened there are no refugees just settlers forming the base of the populace of the gatekeepers 
- [3:04 AM] Player: Ok. So that IS what you were getting at.
DM: yes

---

## Player/DM Speculation

- [2:38 AM] Player: I feel like Eldricus is gonezo because surcidahl locked him in timeout for a lot longer than 1k years ( this is a very good question )
- [2:49 AM] Player: I'm torn. Because you would think that she (Tsuki) at least is AWARE of Dax getting her out of limbo..... And even IF it didn't matter. The effort was made by a mortal, for no selfish reasons. ( guess the player and or players will find out... maybe)
- [2:50 AM] Player: I hoped for a little more interaction. Not appreciation. Interaction (Tsuki)
- [2:52 AM] Player: At least some "acknowledgment" after she (Tsuki) was more.... Herself.
- [2:58 AM] Player: As in. Plan in motion for sucksonnuts (Sucirdle) to remake everything HIS way. See Previous reference
- [2:26 AM] Player: And why were these people being hunted by the 12........ No.... These are from another realm that was destroyed. Aren't they?
DM the 12 who is that?
DM i'm not sure who this cult of the 12 you speak of even is
verifying that along with the other space time weirdness the previous enemy of the Gatwardend and the reffugies ( now settlers) do not in any way shape or form seem to have ever existed since Sucirdle destroyed the pocket dimention ( about a day or two ago) as well as killing Eldricus aka the head master aka the first one... are they linke if so what parts are or are not linked what in all of everything is going on here
