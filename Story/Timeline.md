# Seraphia Campaign Timeline

A chronological timeline of all major events, cosmological epochs, and campaign milestones as currently understood. This will be refined for continuity and accuracy.

---

## Prehistory & Creation
- **Before All Calendars:**
  - Tsuki, the Mother of All Creation, spins the fabric of existence.
  - The Golden City (pocket dimension) is created as a sanctuary for her first children: Aurelia (Sun) and Selene (Moon).
  - Aurelia and Selene become mothers to Sucirdle and Eldricus, and the rest of the denizens of the golden city.

## The Betrayal & The Ejection
- **Eons in the Golden City (before BoG calendar):**
  - Sucirdle, twisted by envy, orchestrates a rebellion among the Twelve Rebellious Gods.
  - The Battle of Sucirdle's Betrayal rages for eons.
  - The Golden City's harmony is shattered; the denizens of the golden city are ejected into the wider cosmos and become the gods of the mortal realms.
  - 
  - **BoG calendar begins.**
  - Future storeys to be determined 
  - Many events among the former denizens (details TBD).

## DR Era ( i believe this is the normal D&D calendar system)

## The Long Exile & The Pocket Dimension:**
  - (time in the pocket dimension, 1 eon in the pocket dimension = 1 year in the primatial dimension )
  - Eldricus, barely escaping destruction (in 1300 DR), enters a rift in time and space, aided by Tsuki.
  - For what feels like 500,000 years, Eldricus regains his power in the empty pocket dimension.
  - 

## The Creation of Seraphia
- **After 500,000 years in the pocket dimension:**
  - Eldricus begins the creation of Seraphia, a new world and sanctuary.
  - The true beginning of a new era, conceptually from Eldricus personal beliefs; Seraphia is a reimagined Golden City.
  - Eldricus, takes 1 eon to create his vision for Seraphia

## The Age of Forgotten Origins
- **Early Seraphia (post-creation):**
  - Over the course of the next 500,000 years, as perceived in the pocket dimension, Eldricus collects willing citizens from all the realms and dimensions outside the pocket dimension
  - Mortals and immortals live unaware of their true origins.
  - The Golden City only a mere legend, to all but the oldest of beings.
  - during this 500,000 years the people, the different species intermingle and evolve into the culmination of what they are, "today"
