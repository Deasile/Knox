# The Story So Far

## Prologue: The Loom of Fate

In the beginning, there was Tsuki - the Mother of All Creation. From her boundless essence, she spun the fabric of existence, birthing the Golden City as a sanctuary for her first children: Aurelia, Priestess of the Sun, and Selene, Priestess of the Moon. These radiant sisters, embodiments of light and tranquility, lived in perfect harmony, their laughter echoing through the halls of the Golden City. But even paradise is not immune to envy and ambition.

## The Betrayal and the Birth of the Gods

Aurelia and Selene, each in turn, became mothers to Sucirdle and Eldricus, Eldricus born only moments before Sucirdle. Eldricus, the embodiment of order and creation, inspired gods and mortals alike to kindness and love. Sucirdle, a brother of sorts to Eldricus, was the master of chaos and discord, his heart twisted by envy of Eldricus's adoration. In secret, Sucirdle whispered lies and sowed doubt, orchestrating a rebellion among the Twelve Rebellious Gods. The resulting cataclysm, the Betrayal, shattered the Golden City's harmony. The Battle of Sucirdle's Betrayal raged for eons, culminating in the ejection of the city's denizens and the gods' emergence into the wider cosmos. Thus began the BoG calendar, and the world of Seraphia was forever changed.

## The Age of Forgotten Origins

Seraphia, a realm born from the ashes of cosmic conflict, became a haven for those chosen by The First One (Eldricus) from across dimensions. Here, mortals and immortals alike lived, blissfully unaware of their true origins, as the memory of the Betrayal faded into myth. The Golden City, now a legend, lingered in the dreams of the wise and the mad.

## The Dax Family and the Silken Phoenix

In the city of Yusaf'hed, pride and pleasure reigned. Here, Velistra Dax, matron of the Silken Phoenix, ruled with wisdom and grace. Her son, Feren Dax, was raised amidst intrigue and elegance, trained in etiquette, swordplay, and the subtle arts of politics. Feren's best friend, Torri Spellguard, was a quiet pillar of strength, her presence a balm against the city's machinations. Solaris Nova, Velistra's beloved, met a tragic end at the hands of Garamith, a pawn in the cosmic game of Xorvintaal. Solaris's soul, however, would not rest, finding new purpose in an ancient Warforged body.

## The Party Forms: Heroes and Outcasts

Feren Dax, haunted by legacy and loss, set forth from Yusaf'hed, joined by a band of unlikely heroes: Biggus Menethil, the resourceful Rune Carver; Milicia Valen, the half-orc paladin torn between mercy and might; and Yo, the halfling druid whose wild heart hid a well of courage. Each brought their own burdens and secrets, their destinies woven together by unseen hands.


## The Loom of Souls and the Rewriting of Reality

Their adventures took them to Mogo, the living god-planet and realm of souls, where the dead are cleansed and prepared for rebirth. Here, the party encountered Ziggy and the dragon village, navigated shifting alliances, and faced the truth of their own existence. Through courage and sacrifice, they broke the cycle of endless repetition, releasing a new harmony into the cosmos.


## The Game of Dragons (Unseen)

Unbeknownst to the party, a greater game unfolds in the shadows one played by ancient dragons manipulating fate from afar. During their travels, the party encountered two enigmatic figures in a magical spring: Brimstone (Cappo), a devilishly handsome middle-aged man, and Chendarixanath (Chen), an old, slightly sinister-looking man. Both radiated a subtle, sinister energy and answered the party's questions with evasions and riddles, never revealing their true nature.

The party, blissfully unaware of the true significance of this meeting, overlooked the influence of these two. In truth, Cappo and Chen were locked in a cosmic contest, wagering on the party's fate and subtly shaping events from behind the scenes. Only the most extraordinary perception or magical insight could have revealed their true forms: dragons, manipulating the world as if it were a game board. For now, the party remains ignorant of the game of dragons, their destinies entwined with powers they cannot yet comprehend.


## The Urn of Fate

Garamith, a cruel and twisted man, was driven by an insatiable lust for power. Corrupted further by Cappo's manipulations, he sought two legendary artifacts: the forbidden urn  capable of imprisoning even the divine  and the Whip of Orcus, a tool to command the Demon Prince of Undeath. (See: https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orcus)

**NPC Reference: Orcus**
- **Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath:** A monstrous demon lord of the Abyss, master of necromancy and the undead. In this tale, Orcus is bound and manipulated by Garamith through the Whip of Orcus, forced to serve the villain's ambitions. His presence brings terror and corruption, and his will is a constant threat to the living.

But fate intervened. This time, unbeknownst to Garamith, the party discovered the urn before he could claim it, denying him the ultimate power he craved. Still wielding the Whip of Orcus and having bent Orcus to his will, Garamith continued his search for the urn while pursuing his other schemes. Seeking to reclaim the Silken Phoenix, he used Orcus to kidnap baby Zara Dax, hoping to use her as leverage to threaten Velistra Dax and force his way back into power. The party, however, intervened, saving Zara and preventing Garamith from plunging the Silken Phoenix back into depravity.

The cost was not small. Solaris Nova lost her life in the struggle, only to be restored by the powerful magics of Velistra Dax, aided by her steadfast ally Al. Through courage and sacrifice, the party not only saved Zara but also set in motion the events that would free the Sun and Moon priestesses from their prison. Guided by fate and the enigmatic goddess Tsuki, they averted a cosmic reset, saving all worlds from oblivion.

Their adventures took them to Mogo, the living god-planet and realm of souls, where the dead are cleansed and prepared for rebirth. Here, the party encountered Ziggy and the dragon village, navigated shifting alliances, and faced the truth of their own existence. Through courage and sacrifice, they broke the cycle of endless repetition, releasing a new harmony into the cosmos.

## The Mystery of Miliciaâ€™s People

Upon returning from their odyssey, the party found Milicia's people transformed. Once refugees, haunted by war and terror, they now lived as peaceful settlers, their memories of suffering erased. Only Milicia and the party remembered the truth, sensing that their actions had rewritten reality itself. The cult of the 12, once a looming threat, had vanished from history, leaving only questions and unease.

## The Present: Threads Yet Unraveled

Now, as the Ninth-day of the 19th Mirtul, 1500 DR dawns, the party stands at the crossroads of fate. The gods watch from afar, their own destinies entwined with those of mortals. The Golden City's secrets beckon, the game of dragons continues, and the true nature of Tsuki's design remains shrouded in mystery. Each hero must choose their path, for the story is far from over - and the next chapter awaits those bold enough to seize it.
