# Epilogue: The Dawning of a New Fate

## Prologue: The Divine Order and the Golden City

In the beginning, there was only Tsuki, the Mother of All Creation. Over countless eons, Tsuki grew bored and began to create. Her first children were Aurelia, Priestess of the Sun, and Selene, Priestess of the Moon. Together, they brought light and tranquility to the world, their bond forming the foundation of harmony and the cycle of day and night.

From Selene, Tsuki granted the birth of Eldricus, the First One, embodiment of order, creation, and cosmic law. From Aurelia, Sucirdle was born, destined to embody chaos and discord. The Golden City, a pocket dimension created by Tsuki, became the sanctuary for her children and their descendants  a place of perfect harmony, where the sun and moon danced in unity.

For eons, Aurelia and Selene nurtured the world, their laughter echoing through the Golden City. Eldricus, revered for his benevolence and creativity, inspired gods and mortals alike to kindness and love. But Sucirdle, envious of his brother's influence, began to sow discord, whispering lies and planting seeds of doubt among the city's inhabitants and the priestesses themselves.

The harmony was shattered when Sucirdle manipulated Aurelia and Selene into conflict, exploiting their bond and orchestrating their imprisonment in a powerful urn. With the priestesses locked away, the Golden City fell into shadow, and Sucirdle gathered eleven other powerful beings to challenge Eldricus. Thus began the Battle of Sucirdle's Betrayal - a cataclysmic clash that would determine the fate of the Golden City and all existence.

Eldricus, though alone, stood against the tide of chaos, fighting not just for himself but for the return of balance and the hope of all creation. The echoes of this battle would shape the destiny of gods and mortals for ages to come.

## Part 2: The Weaver Revealed


Unbeknownst to the party, every step they took was guided by Tsuki, the primordial weaver of fate. She is the rebirther of all existence, the architect behind every connection: Alabol as Patron, Milicia's gods, the mysterious book in Feren Dax's motherâ€™s possession. The Sun and Moon priestesses, her first children, were freed by the party, releasing a new harmony into the cosmos. Tsuki's hand was always present, unseen but ever guiding, setting the party on a path to break the cycle of endless repetition.

This is the moment of revelation not for the characters, but for you, the players. Tsuki's influence has shaped every major event, and her hopes now rest with those who dared to defy fate.

## Part 3: The Choice That Changed Everything


Through a series of small but crucial actions, the party prevented the total erasure and reset of existence, as has happened countless times before. The first meeting with Feren Dax took place on Mogo, the living god-planet and realm of souls, where the dead are cleansed and prepared for rebirth. (Henceforth, this realm shall be known as "The Loom of Souls.")

Had the Urn containing the Sun and Moon priestesses not been found and opened by the party, or even by someone else before Garamith, the Old Man, he could have corrupted them and ended all existence leaving only Tsuki to begin anew. Instead, the party's choices averted a cosmic restart, saving all worlds from oblivion.

The urn itself was not discovered until some time later, in the wastelands of the desert, as the party traveled back to Feren Dax's hometown in the City States of the Black Desert. Their journey was meant to celebrate Feren Dax's birthday, but was shadowed by an ominous warning that his mother might have gotten into a bit of a situation. It was during this return, amidst shifting sands and uncertainty, that fate placed the urn in their path forever altering the course of their story.

## Part 4: A New Dawn for the Gate Wardens


The refugees from Milicia's home are now, somehow, settlers putting down roots and building a future as if they had never known fear. This is not just a change, but an impossibility. Milicia's entire mission, her life's purpose, was to find these people a safe haven away from the endless war with the cult of the 12. All her memories are of running, fighting, struggling, and living in constant terror of extermination. Yet now, as the party returns to her most recent home campsite, only shortly after the destruction of the pocket dimension, home to Bigus and Yo, Milicia is confronted with a reality that makes no sense.

The transformation is not just strange it is deeply unsettling. For Milicia, every day of her life has been shaped by the need to protect her people from annihilation. The cult of the 12 was a constant threat, forcing them to move from place to place, never able to rest, always ready to flee. Now, inexplicably, the people she fought so hard to save have no memory of this struggle. They speak of settling, of building, as if they have always been safe.


The once-refugees no longer remember ever being in danger. There is no war, no running for their lives, no moving from place to place, no living in fear of an inevitable attack from the cult of the 12. In some incomprehensible twist of fate, they are simply settlers, putting down roots instead of being ready to flee. Not a single member of the village recalls the terror or the cult's threat. Only Milicia, and by extension the party, remember the truth. The party is confused and on guard, for Milicia has told them of the refugees' life of abject terror, but now, not a single soul remembers this. Something is not right, and Milicia knows it deep in her bones.

The party stands with Milicia, bewildered and wary. They have heard her stories of fear and flight, and now witness a world that denies her every memory. The sense of unease is palpable something fundamental has changed, and only a handful remember the truth. The mystery of the missing war, and the vanished cult, lingers like a shadow over the new dawn.


Feren Dax, by his own choices, became the lynchpin of fate. Even the DM expected multiple resets before success, but Feren Dax's hope and courage changed the course of destiny.

Yet, is this inexplicable transformation of Milicia's people this erasure of fear and memory somehow part of Dax's impact on fate? Or is it an unrelated twist, a coincidence in a world now unmoored from its past? The answer remains uncertain, but the timing is highly suspect, and the party cannot help but wonder if their actions have changed more than they ever intended.

## Part 5: The Road Ahead


Is Eldricus truly gone, or merely imprisoned for an age? Will Tsuki ever acknowledge the party's efforts, or is her gratitude shown only through the unfolding of fate? And what of the bizarre mystery surrounding Milicia's people will the truth of their lost memories and sudden peace ever be revealed, or is it a consequence of the party's actions that will haunt them in chapters yet to come? These questions remain, inviting you to shape the next chapter.

And the pocket dimension though gone for now, is there a way to restore it? Is this something you can change, something that can be fixed? Only time may tell.


The fate of all existence now delicately lays solely at the behest of the party. The story is yours to continue.

## Part 6: Prologue to Chapter 2


What is certain is this: you have prevented the inevitable destruction and rebirth of everything an endless cycle that has happened many times over. But how many, you wonder? One, ten, a thousand, trillions, more than is fathomably countable? We may never know. But this time, this time it is different.

What happens next... no one knows. As you, the players, embark on a new path never before taken, a new, exciting, unimaginable story begins. The fate of all existence now delicately lays solely at the behest of the party. What will you choose to do? What future will you forge? What destiny shall bend to your will? Shall you take the challenge, shall you charge headlong into the abyss of the unknown and truly become the heroes of legend? Only time will tell.

Luckily, you have plenty of it after all, through a myriad of circumstances, everyone now enjoys a touch of ageless immortality. So take your time... the next adventure awaits!
