# The Story So Far

## Prologue: The Loom of Fate

In the beginning, there was Tsuki - the Mother of All Creation. From her boundless essence, she spun the fabric of existence, birthing the Golden City as a sanctuary for her first children: Aurelia, Priestess of the Sun, and Selene, Priestess of the Moon. These radiant sisters, embodiments of light and tranquility, lived in perfect harmony, their laughter echoing through the halls of the Golden City. But even paradise is not immune to envy and ambition.

## The Betrayal and the Birth of the Gods

Aurelia and Selene, each in turn, became mothers to Sucirdle and Eldricus, Eldricus born only moments before Sucirdle. Eldricus, the embodiment of order and creation, inspired gods and mortals alike to kindness and love. Sucirdle, a brother of sorts to Eldricus, was the master of chaos and discord, his heart twisted by envy of Eldricus's adoration. In secret, Sucirdle whispered lies and sowed doubt, orchestrating a rebellion among the Twelve Rebellious Gods. The resulting cataclysm, the Betrayal, shattered the Golden City's harmony. The Battle of Sucirdle's Betrayal raged for eons, culminating in the ejection of the city's denizens and the gods' emergence into the wider cosmos. Thus began the BoG calendar.

**Relative Time and the Birth of Seraphia**

Time in the Golden City (the pocket dimension) was before all calendar systems. The ejection from the Golden City marked the end of an era, and the beginning of the BoG calendar.

Relative time: in the prime material plane, one year equals one eon in the pocket dimension. However, travel between the two is relative--if a person leaves the pocket dimension for one day, only one day passes for them, regardless of the time outside. To the traveler's perspective, time remains consistent.

Though you might already know that this pocket dimension space would become Seraphia itself much, much later, many events occurred during the BoG era among the former denizens of the Golden City (not yet written here).

After or during the battle between Eldricus and the Twelve Rebellious Gods led by Sucirdle, in the year 1300 DR, Eldricus barely escaped destruction by entering a rift in time and space--an act only possible due to the unseen will of Tsuki.

Eldricus slowly regained his power for what felt like 500,000 years in the seemingly timeless pocket dimension (formerly the Golden City; see the relative time reference above). Only after this vast span was he able to begin the creation of Seraphia: a new world, a sanctuary born from emptiness and memory. Its creation marked the true beginning of a new era, for Eldricus' vision was one of a reimagined Golden City where god and mortal alike could live in peace and harmony, free from the pains and strife of the prime material plane.

## The Age of Forgotten Origins

Seraphia, a realm born from the ashes of cosmic conflict, became a haven for those chosen by The First One (Eldricus) from across dimensions. Here, mortals and immortals alike lived, blissfully unaware of their true origins, as the memory of the Betrayal faded into myth. The Golden City, now a legend, lingered in the dreams of the wise and the mad.

## The Dax Family and the Silken Phoenix

### Velistra Dax – The Velvet Whisper of Yusaf’hed
**Establishment:** The Silken Phoenix

In the City of Pride, beauty is a weapon, and wit is the whetstone.

Velistra Dax never needed to raise her voice or brandish a blade to be respected. Her presence alone could tilt the room. With a glance, she could dismiss the boastful. With a smile, she could unravel the guarded. A vision in silks that shimmered like desert heat, she built The Silken Phoenix into a sanctuary of refinement—where suitors came not for indulgence alone, but for acceptance, if they were deemed worthy.

But make no mistake—Velistra was not a schemer. She was a judge. Not cruel, not cold, but deeply principled. She chose her company with care, and she taught her son the same: not everyone who seeks your fire deserves to hold it.

Feren Dax, her only child, was raised among the city’s most poised and powerful, taught etiquette by songstresses, swordplay by hired blades, and politics from whispered games of courtly flirtation played behind beaded curtains. Velistra never sought to mold him into a shadow of herself—only to give him the tools to define himself on his own terms, with grace, strength, and a quiet confidence that would outlast spectacle.

---

*Legacy summary:*
In the city of Yusaf'hed, pride and pleasure reigned. Here, Velistra Dax, matron of the Silken Phoenix, ruled with wisdom and grace. Her son, Feren Dax, was raised amidst intrigue and elegance, trained in etiquette, swordplay, and the subtle arts of politics. Feren's best friend, Torri Spellguard, was a quiet pillar of strength, her presence a balm against the city's machinations. Solaris Nova, Velistra's beloved, met a tragic end at the hands of Garamith, a pawn in the cosmic game of Xorvintaal. Solaris's soul, however, would not rest, finding new purpose in an ancient Warforged body.

## The Party Forms: Heroes and Outcasts

Feren Dax, haunted by legacy and loss, set forth from Yusaf'hed, joined by a band of unlikely heroes: Biggus Menethil, the resourceful Rune Carver; Milicia Valen, the half-orc paladin torn between mercy and might; and Yo, the halfling druid whose wild heart hid a well of courage. Each brought their own burdens and secrets, their destinies woven together by unseen hands.

## The Loom of Souls and the Rewriting of Reality

Their adventures took them to Mogo, the living god-planet and realm of souls, where the dead are cleansed and prepared for rebirth. Here, the party encountered Ziggy and the dragon village, navigated shifting alliances, and faced the truth of their own existence. Through courage and sacrifice, they broke the cycle of endless repetition, releasing a new harmony into the cosmos.

## The Game of Dragons (Unseen)

Unbeknownst to the party, a greater game unfolds in the shadows, one played by ancient dragons manipulating fate from afar. During their travels, the party encountered two enigmatic figures in a magical spring: Brimstone (Cappo), a devilishly handsome middle-aged man, and Chendarixanath (Chen), an old, slightly sinister-looking man. Both radiated a subtle, sinister energy and answered the party's questions with evasions and riddles, never revealing their true nature.

The party, blissfully unaware of the true significance of this meeting, overlooked the influence of these two. In truth, Cappo and Chen were locked in a cosmic contest, wagering on the party's fate and subtly shaping events from behind the scenes. Only the most extraordinary perception or magical insight could have revealed their true forms: dragons, manipulating the world as if it were a game board. For now, the party remains ignorant of the game of dragons, their destinies entwined with powers they cannot yet comprehend.

## The Urn of Fate

Garamith, a cruel and twisted man, was driven by an insatiable lust for power. Corrupted further by Cappo's manipulations, he sought two legendary artifacts: the forbidden urn, capable of imprisoning even the divine, and the Whip of Orcus, a tool to command the Demon Prince of Undeath. (See: https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orcus)

**NPC Reference: Orcus**
- Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath: A monstrous demon lord of the Abyss, master of necromancy and the undead. In this tale, Orcus is bound and manipulated by Garamith through the Whip of Orcus, forced to serve the villain's ambitions. His presence brings terror and corruption, and his will is a constant threat to the living.

But fate intervened. This time, unbeknownst to Garamith, the party discovered the urn before he could claim it, denying him the ultimate power he craved. Still wielding the Whip of Orcus and having bent Orcus to his will, Garamith continued his search for the urn while pursuing his other schemes. Seeking to reclaim the Silken Phoenix, he used Orcus to kidnap baby Zara Dax, hoping to use her as leverage to threaten Velistra Dax and force his way back into power. The party, however, intervened, saving Zara and preventing Garamith from plunging the Silken Phoenix back into depravity.

The cost was not small. Solaris Nova lost her life in the struggle, only to be restored by the powerful magics of Velistra Dax, aided by her steadfast ally Al. Through courage and sacrifice, the party not only saved Zara but also set in motion the events that would free the Sun and Moon priestesses from their prison. Guided by fate and the enigmatic goddess Tsuki, they averted a cosmic reset, saving all worlds from oblivion.

## The Mystery of Milicia's People

Upon returning from their odyssey, the party found Milicia's people transformed. Once refugees, haunted by war and terror, they now lived as peaceful settlers, their memories of suffering erased. Only Milicia and the party remembered the truth, sensing that their actions had rewritten reality itself. The cult of the 12, once a looming threat, had vanished from history, leaving only questions and unease.

## The Shattering of the Pocket Dimension and the Fate of Eldricus

The climax of the first chapter saw the destruction of the pocket dimension, the sanctuary created by Tsuki for her children and their descendants. The Cult of the Twelve, demonic creations of Sucirdle, invaded the Ethereal Ascendance Institute, seeking to destroy The First One, Eldricus. In a desperate battle, Rowan Fleetfoot and the party stood as the last line of defense. Despite their courage, the forces of Sucirdle shattered the dimension, and Eldricus was lost, either destroyed or imprisoned beyond reach. Only Biggus and Yo survived the cataclysm, cast adrift in a world forever changed. Even the gods Ceridwen, Hephaestus, and others seemed to vanish in the aftermath.

## The Aftermath: A Changed World

As the party returned to the world outside, they found reality itself altered. Milicia's people, once refugees haunted by war and terror, now lived as peaceful settlers, their memories of suffering erased. The cult of the 12, once a looming threat, had vanished from history. Only Milicia and the party remembered the truth, sensing that their actions had rewritten reality itself. The world was at peace, but the cost, and the mystery, remained.

## The Divine Hand Revealed

Unbeknownst to the party, every step they took was guided by Tsuki, the primordial weaver of fate. Her influence shaped every major event, from the freeing of the Sun and Moon priestesses to the party's role in averting a cosmic reset. The Loom of Souls, the realm of Mogo, and the party's choices all played into Tsuki's design, breaking the cycle of endless repetition and saving all worlds from oblivion.

## The Present: Threads Yet Unraveled

Now, as the Ninth-day of the 19th Mirtul, 1500 DR dawns, the party stands at the crossroads of fate. The gods watch from afar, their own destinies entwined with those of mortals. The Golden City's secrets beckon, the game of dragons continues, and the true nature of Tsuki's design remains shrouded in mystery. Each hero must choose their path, for the story is far from over, and the next chapter awaits those bold enough to seize it.
