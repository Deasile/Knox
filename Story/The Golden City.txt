This is the current Story of the Golden City as seen from mortal perspective, in which only a handful of mortals and oracles have even gleaned from the tapestry of fate woven by Tsuki herself.

Once upon a time, in a realm beyond the grasp of time itself, there existed a magnificent city known only as the Golden City. It was a place bathed in eternal light, where the sun and the moon danced in perfect harmony. Within this radiant haven lived the Priestess of the Sun, Aurelia, and the Priestess of the Moon, Selene. They were not just guardians of their celestial bodies; they were entwined in a bond that transcended love, an unbreakable connection forged in the very essence of their beings.

For eons that stretched like the horizon at dawn, Aurelia and Selene shared their days in blissful unity, nurturing the world around them. The sun's warmth and the moon's gentle glow coalesced to create a cycle of life that flourished under their watchful eyes. Every dawn brought forth the vibrant colors of life, while every dusk enveloped the world in tranquil serenity. Their laughter echoed through the Golden City, a melody that resonated with all who would eventually inhabit it.

But the tranquility of this realm was soon to be disrupted by the emergence of two new beings: Eldricus and Sucirdle. Unlike the harmonious Priestess of the Sun and the Priestess of the Moon, these two were stark contrasts, personifying the duality of existence itself. Eldricus, with his radiant spirit, thrived on creation, breathing life into the fabric of reality with every thought and action. He was a beacon of light, nurturing growth and fostering balance. In stark opposition stood Sucirdle, a figure cloaked in shadows, who reveled in chaos and discord. Where Eldricus sowed seeds of order, Sucirdle delighted in uprooting them, turning harmony into discord. 

As Eldricus created gravity to anchor the stars, Sucirdle conjured forces of repulsion to scatter them. When Eldricus warmed the world with the sun's embrace, Sucirdle summoned the chill of night to steal away that warmth. Their existence became a perpetual dance of creation and destruction, light and dark, life and death, a cosmic ballet that echoed through the Golden City.

As time passed, the inhabitants of the Golden City began to revere Eldricus for his benevolence and creativity. They sang songs of gratitude for the life he infused into their world, believing him to be the architect of their very existence. Sucirdle, consumed by envy, could not bear the adulation heaped upon his rival. In the shadows, he conspired and whispered lies, planting seeds of doubt and mistrust. 

Beware the one who brings forth creation, he hissed to the people. Eldricus seeks to seize your hearts and bend them to his will. He is a usurper in the guise of a savior. These insidious words slithered into the minds of the citizens, sowing discord among them. 

But Sucirdle's cunning did not stop there. He turned his gaze towards the two priestesses, Aurelia and Selene, and cunningly exploited the fragile threads of their bond. He spun a web of deception that suggested their unity was a façade, that their powers were incompatible. The once inseparable pair began to falter, their energies clashing whenever they drew near. The balance of the Golden City hung precariously, as the divide between sun and moon deepened.

As the rift widened, Sucirdle orchestrated a grand deception. He lured both priestesses into a confrontation, whispering sweet lies that stoked their fears and insecurities. The other seeks to overshadow you, he taunted in hushed tones. “Only one can reign supreme.” Reluctantly, Aurelia and Selene found themselves standing on opposite sides, their hearts heavy with betrayal. 

In the midst of this conflict, Sucirdle struck. With a flick of his wrist, he summoned a powerful urn, infused with ancient magics that could imprison even the mightiest of beings. As the two priestesses unleashed their powers against each other, he seized the moment, ensnaring them within the urn and sealing it with countless enchantments. The light of the sun and the glow of the moon dimmed, and the Golden City fell into shadow. 

With the priestesses locked away, Sucirdle reveled in his newfound dominion. He consolidated his rule over the remaining inhabitants, bending them to his will with fear and manipulation. Yet, in the depths of his triumph, he felt a lingering unease. Eldricus, though weakened, remained a formidable force, a spark of hope that refused to flicker out. 

Recognizing the threat Eldricus posed, Sucirdle sought to eliminate him once and for all. He gathered eleven other powerful beings, each drawn to his side by promises of power and influence. Together, they conspired to extinguish the last light of creation. Thus began the Great Battle of the First One and the Twelve, a cataclysmic clash that would determine the fate of the Golden City and the very essence of existence itself. 

As the skies darkened and the earth trembled, Eldricus stood alone against the tide of chaos. With a heart full of resolve and a spirit ignited by the love that once flourished between Aurelia and Selene, he prepared to fight not just for himself, but for the return of balance to the world. The echoes of the past rang in his ears, reminding him of the harmony that once existed, a harmony worth fighting for. 

And so, the stage was set for a battle that would echo through the annals of time, a clash of light against dark, creation against destruction, and hope against despair. The fate of the Golden City hung in the balance, poised on the brink of a new dawn, or an eternal night.
