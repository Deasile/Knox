## The End of Chapter One: The Shattering of the Pocket Dimension

The final moments of the first chapter saw the obliteration of the pocket dimension, the sanctuary created by Tsuki for her children and their descendants. The Cult of the Twelve, demonic creations of Sucirdle, descended upon the Ethereal Ascendance Institute, seeking to destroy The First One, Eldricus. In a desperate battle, Rowan Fleetfoot and the party stood as the last line of defense. Despite their courage, the forces of Sucirdle shattered the dimension, and Eldricus was lost, either destroyed or imprisoned beyond reach. Only Biggus and Yo survived the cataclysm, cast adrift in a world forever changed. Even the gods Ceridwen, Hephaestus, and others seemed to vanish in the aftermath.

## The Aftermath: A Changed World

As the party returned to the world outside, they found reality itself altered. Milicia's people, once refugees haunted by war and terror, now lived as peaceful settlers, their memories of suffering erased. The cult of the 12, once a looming threat, had vanished from history. Only Milicia and the party remembered the truth, sensing that their actions had rewritten reality itself. The world was at peace, but the cost, and the mystery, remained.

## The Divine Hand Revealed

Unbeknownst to the party, every step they took was guided by Tsuki, the primordial weaver of fate. Her influence shaped every major event, from the freeing of the Sun and Moon priestesses to the party's role in averting a cosmic reset. The Loom of Souls, the realm of Mogo, and the party's choices all played into Tsuki's design, breaking the cycle of endless repetition and saving all worlds from oblivion.

## Prologue: The Road to Chapter Two

Now, as the dust settles, new questions arise. Is Eldricus truly gone, or merely imprisoned for an age? Will Tsuki ever acknowledge the party's efforts, or is her gratitude shown only through the unfolding of fate? And what of the bizarre mystery surrounding Milicia's people, will the truth of their lost memories and sudden peace ever be revealed, or is it a consequence of the party's actions that will haunt them in chapters yet to come?

The Golden City's secrets beckon, the game of dragons continues, and the true nature of Tsuki's design remains shrouded in mystery. The next chapter awaits those bold enough to seize it.

The fate of all existence now delicately lays solely at the behest of the party. The story is yours to continue.
