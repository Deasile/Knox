# Design Standards

## Purpose
Centralize all technical details, code standards, and visual design rules for the D&D campaign site.

## Inline Style-Driven HTML
- Use inline styles for local control, CSS classes for repeated logic.
- Section comments for all major blocks.
- Header, main, and footer must follow SOP standards.

## Color Combinations
- Top-rated combos for readability and theme (see chatlog.md for ratings).
- Use approved color schemes for headings, names, descriptions, and highlights.

## Layout Standards
- Header: Fixed, predictable height, SOP-compliant navigation.
- Main: margin-top at least 10rem, max-width: 900px, centered.
- Footer: Use index.html format for all character pages.

## Accessibility
- Ensure color contrast and accessibility for all text and backgrounds.
- Test for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

## Example Code Snippets
- See SOP.md and character pages for reference implementations.
