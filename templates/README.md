# How to Use the Automation Templates

## 1. VS Code Snippets
- Add `html.code-snippets` and `css.code-snippets` from the `templates` folder to your VS Code user or workspace snippets.
- Use shortcut prefixes (`sop-header-footer`, `section-comment`, `sop-main-margin`) to quickly insert SOP-compliant code.

## 2. Batch Script
- Run `copy-templates.bat` from the `templates` folder to copy templates to your clipboard and display the verification checklist.
- Paste the copied content directly into your target HTML/CSS files.

## 3. Verification Checklist
- Use `verification-checklist.md` as a live reference during refactoring and review.
- Check off each item to ensure SOP/template compliance.

## 4. Commit Hook Template
- After each commit, use `commit-hook-template.txt` to document changes, update logs, and record lessons learned in `chatlog.md`.

## 5. Documentation & Standards
- Refer to `Workflow.md`, `Verification.md`, `Rules.md`, and `DesignStandards.md` for process, compliance, and technical standards.
