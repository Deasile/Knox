# Rules

## Purpose
Define the scope, usage, and boundaries of each documentation file in the D&D campaign site project. Ensure clarity and prevent scope creep.

---

## Documentation File Scopes
- **SOP.md**: Contains standard operating procedures, template rules, and best practices for refactoring and maintaining site files.
- **DesignStandards.md**: Centralizes technical standards, code rules, visual guidelines, and accessibility requirements.
- **Workflow.md**: Documents the step-by-step process for refactoring, updating, and verifying files, including roles and collaboration.
- **Verification.md**: Lists verification steps, checklists, and standards for ensuring SOP/template compliance and technical quality.
- **chatlog.md**: Serves as a change log, records lessons learned, and documents rationale for decisions and updates.
- **ProjectDocs.md**: Proposes and maintains the overall documentation structure and organization for the project.

---

## Usage Guidelines
- Each file should only contain content relevant to its defined scope.
- Avoid duplicating information across files; reference other files as needed.
- Update documentation files promptly after changes, refactors, or lessons learned.
- Use section comments and clear headings for maintainability.
- Document rationale for major decisions in chatlog.md.

---

## Change Management
- Any change to documentation structure or scope must be proposed in ProjectDocs.md and reviewed before implementation.
- Major updates should be logged in chatlog.md with rationale and lessons learned.
- Technical standards must be updated in DesignStandards.md and referenced in SOP.md.
