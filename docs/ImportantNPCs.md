# Important NPCs


## Divine and Cosmic Hierarchy
- **Tsuki (The Mother of All Creation):** The primordial being, source of all matter, energy, and existence. Creator of Aurelia (Priestess of the Sun) and Selene (Priestess of the Moon). Grandmother of Eldricus and Sucirdle. Designed the Golden City as a pocket dimension and sanctuary for her creations. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Tsuki.md]
- **Selene (Priestess of the Moon):** First creation of Tsuki, guardian of night and tranquility, mother of Eldricus. Shared a transcendent bond with Aurelia. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Selene.md]
- **Aurelia (Priestess of the Sun):** First creation of Tsuki, guardian of light and warmth, mother of Sucirdle. Shared a transcendent bond with Selene. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Aurelia.md]
- **Eldricus (The Headmaster, The First One):** Son of Selene, third being to exist, embodiment of order, creation, and cosmic law, born moments before Sucirdle. Bringer of kindness, love, and positive change to gods and mortals. Central to the campaign's cosmic lore. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Eldricus.md]
- **Sucirdle:** Son of Aurelia, a brother of sorts to Eldricus, embodiment of chaos and discord, born moments after Eldricus. Master manipulator, leader of the Twelve rebellious gods, orchestrator of the betrayal and the Battle of Sucirdle's Betrayal. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Sucirdle.md]


**The Golden City:** A pocket dimension created by Tsuki as a controlled space for her first children and their descendants. Once a place of perfect harmony, it became the stage for the Betrayal and the Birth of the Gods (1 BoG) - the pivotal event where Sucirdle, envious of Eldricus's adoration, led the Twelve Rebellious Gods in conflict against Eldricus. This Battle of Sucirdle's Betrayal occurred 2,000 years ago (1300 DR) in the primatial plane, which translates to two eons in the Golden City (Seraphia), where time flows differently. The aftermath saw the ejection of the city's residents and the beginning of the gods' existence in other realms. This event is referenced as both the Betrayal and the Birth of the Gods throughout campaign lore and marks the start of the BoG calendar (not known to players). The current campaign time is Ninth-day, 19th Mirtul, 1500 DR.




## Other Divine and Cosmic Figures
- **Ceridwen:** Goddess of wisdom and learning in Seraphia, reigning over the sacred Library of Ascendia. Her unending quest for enlightenment drives her to collect all knowledge from living worlds and beyond. Though cursed by the 12 ancient gods, she bestows wisdom upon seekers through her vast repository, shaping the minds of those who venture within its hallowed halls. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Ceridwen.md]
- **Alobal:** Mysterious goddess of joy, freedom, and creative chaos. Patron of Feren Dax, often appearing in both male and female forms. Alobal's influence is felt through inspiration, luck, and unexpected boons. Her motives are enigmatic, and she is known for rewarding mortals who act selflessly or with boldness. (See Feren Dax's story and campaign events for more.)
- **Al (Alobal's Male Avatar):** The male avatar of the deity Alobal, appears to guide or test the party.


- **Garamith (The Old Man):** Once a Lovac (head servant) to Cappo (Brimstone), a dragon player in the ancient game of Xorvintaal. Garamith is an unwitting pawn in the cosmic contest between dragons. As a Lovac, he served Cappo, but his actions and ambitions were manipulated by higher powers within the game. His obsession with forbidden knowledge and the urn led to tragedy, including the death and transformation of Solaris Nova. The party is being groomed to become Lovac to Chendarixanath (Chen), another dragon player. (See TheGame.md for more on Xorvintaal.)

## The Urn of Fate (Lore Update)

If Garamith had acquired and opened the urn, it would have triggered the end of all existence, resetting reality itself. This is the very event Tsuki has been striving to prevent across countless iterations. Garamith, with the urn and the power of Palor (the god of wishes), would have sought to dominate Aurelia (Priestess of the Sun) and Selene (Priestess of the Moon). In earlier cycles, this led to catastrophic consequences: the powers of the Sun and Moon priestesses, never meant to be contained by mortals, spiraled out of control, causing cosmic calamity.

In the current iteration, Tsuki has implemented fail-safes to avert this fate. This time, the players discovered the urn first. Through great effort, they freed Palor, Aurelia, and Selene, forever earning the favor of the Priestess of the Sun and the Priestess of the Moon. Tsuki's intervention and the party's actions have, for now, averted another reset and preserved the balance of creation.


## Dax Family and Associates
- **Velistra Dax (Feren Dax's Mother):** Matron of the Silken Phoenix, wise, respected, and Feren Dax's mother. Solaris Nova was her beloved partner in life. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Velistra-Dax.md]
- **Solaris Nova:** Once a human named Solaris, partner in life to Velistra Dax. Murdered by Garamith while he sought a powerful urn. Solaris's soul was later reborn in an ancient Warforged body. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Solaris-Nova.md]
- **Zara (Feren Dax's Sister):** Sibling to Feren Dax, involved in family and campaign events. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Zara-Dax.md]
- **Torri Spellguard (Feren Dax's Best Friend):** Feren Dax's childhood friend, known for loyalty and magical resistance. Now a city guard pillar. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Torri-Spellguard.md]
- **Cyndara Crossfire (Feren Dax's Friend and Ex-Girlfriend):** Former romantic interest of Feren Dax, remains a friend and ally. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Cyndara-Crossfire.md]


## Notable Shopkeepers and Wanderers
- **Lethagar (The Weird Shopkeeper):** Eccentric shopkeeper known for oddities and rare items. Lethagar is an easter egg character inspired by Dr. Who. He first appeared in the Mician village on Mogo a city trapped in unpredictable energies of twisting space and time, causing it to appear and disappear seemingly at random across multiple points in space and time. Lethagar's presence is often a sign of strange temporal events or opportunities. [See: docs/NPCs/NPC-Lethagar.md]
