# The Game (Xorvintaal)

Xorvintaal, also known as "The Game," is an ancient and complex contest played by dragons and their agents across the multiverse. The game is a contest of wits, influence, and manipulation, with rules and traditions that are both arcane and secretive. While much remains hidden, the following is a summary of the known rules and structure as they pertain to your campaign:

## Key Terms
- **Xorvintaal:** The overarching game played by dragons, often using mortals as pawns or agents.
- **Cappo (Brimstone):** Current moniker of one dragon player, master of Garamith.
- **Chen (Chendarixanath):** Current moniker of another dragon player, grooming the party to be her Lovac.
- **Lovac:** Headservant or chief agent of a dragon in the game. Garamith was Lovac to Cappo; the party is being groomed to be Lovac to Chen.
- **Dokaal:** A rank below Lovac, lesser agents or pawns in the game.

## Structure and Roles
- Dragons play Xorvintaal by influencing the world through their Lovac and Dokaal.
- Each dragon may have only one Lovac at a time, but many Dokaal.
- Lovac are trusted with major tasks, secrets, and the execution of the dragon's will.
- Dokaal serve as lesser agents, often unaware of the full scope of the game.

## Known Rules and Traditions
- **No Direct Dragon Conflict:** Dragons may not directly attack each other or their Lovac; all moves must be made through agents and manipulation.
- **Secrecy:** The existence and rules of Xorvintaal are kept secret from most mortals. Only Lovac and some Dokaal are aware of the true nature of the game.
- **Pawns and Influence:** Mortals, organizations, and even entire kingdoms may be manipulated as pawns in the game.
- **Victory Conditions:** The ultimate goal is to outmaneuver rival dragons, gain influence, and achieve secret objectives set by the dragon or the game itself.
- **Promotion and Demotion:** A Dokaal may be promoted to Lovac by proving their worth, while a Lovac may be demoted or replaced if they fail.
- **Unwitting Pawns:** Many agents, including Garamith, may be unaware of their true role or the identity of their dragon master.

## Campaign-Specific Notes
- Garamith was a Lovac to Cappo (Brimstone), acting as a headservant and agent.
- The party is being groomed behind the scenes to become Lovac to Chen (Chendarixanath).
- Sucirdle uses minions like Garamith as pawns in the greater game.
- The game is ongoing, with shifting alliances, secret objectives, and hidden rules.
