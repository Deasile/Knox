## In Memory of Rowan Fleetfoot

Rowan Fleetfoot gave her life defending her family during the invasion of the Cult of the Twelve, demonic creations of Sucirdle, who were sent to hunt down and destroy The First One, Eldricus, headmaster of the Ethereal Ascendance Institute of Eldrisong.

Within the hidden pocket dimension of the school, Rowan was the only soul able to see the cultists for what they truly were. She stood as the first and last line of defense, her unique vision making her indispensable in the desperate struggle.

As the cultists closed in, Rowan fought with unwavering courage at her family's side. The battle raged until the very fabric of the pocket dimension was torn apart by Sucirdle's power. In the end, Rowan fell.

When the dust settled, only Biggus and Yo remained as survivors of the obliterated realm. Even Ceridwen, Hefestus, and the other gods of the world seemed to have perished in the cataclysm.

Rowan's memory endures as a beacon of bravery and love, a reminder of what was lost and what it means to stand against the darkness.
