# Torri Spellguard -- The Mage-breaker of Yusaf'hed

In the early days of Feren's youth, Torri Spellguard was the kind of girl most overlooked, except by the furniture she tripped over and the masters who complained she made their wards fizzle.

The daughter of a seamstress who worked for The Silken Phoenix, Torri was quiet, earnest, and habitually out of step with the pomp and pride of the city. She spoke with a soft voice, apologized often, and preferred the company of stray cats and old guard manuals to that of her peers.

But she was different. Very different.

Magic didn't just ignore her, it recoiled. Charms shattered. Hexes fizzled. Glamours peeled away like paint in the sun. She was a mystery, an anomaly. And in a city obsessed with arcane power, her presence should have marked her for scorn.

Instead, Velistra Dax saw potential. She ensured that Torri was treated with dignity within the Phoenix's walls, and quietly recommended her to a trusted instructor in the city watch.

That's how Torri and Feren became fast friends. Not through some grand moment, but through routine sparring sessions, late night meals after training, and the comfort of sharing silence with someone who didn't expect performance.

Feren, raised among silver tongues and sharp looks, found Torri's sincerity disarming. She never cared for status. Never sought praise. And while she still stumbles over her own boots from time to time, Torri Spellguard has become a pillar of the city guard, a quiet constant in a city built on ego.

Known now among her peers as "The Mage-breaker," she remains humble. Uncomfortable with recognition, and unsure how to respond to salutes or ceremonial honors, she remains grounded by the simple truth: she didn't train to be celebrated, she trained to be useful.

When Feren returns home, Torri's always one of the first to meet him, not with fanfare, but with a nod, a clean blade, and a reliable shoulder if he needs it.
