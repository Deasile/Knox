# Velistra Dax -- The Velvet Whisper of Yusaf'hed

**Establishment:** The Silken Phoenix

In the City of Pride, beauty is a weapon, and wit is the whetstone.

Velistra Dax never needed to raise her voice or brandish a blade to be respected. Her presence alone could tilt the room. With a glance, she could dismiss the boastful. With a smile, she could unravel the guarded. A vision in silks that shimmered like desert heat, she built The Silken Phoenix into a sanctuary of refinement, where suitors came not for indulgence alone, but for acceptance, if they were deemed worthy.

But make no mistake, Velistra was not a schemer. She was a judge. Not cruel, not cold, but deeply principled. She chose her company with care, and she taught her son the same: not everyone who seeks your fire deserves to hold it.

Feren Dax, her only child, was raised among the city's most poised and powerful, taught etiquette by songstresses, swordplay by hired blades, and politics from whispered games of courtly flirtation played behind beaded curtains. Velistra never sought to mold him into a shadow of herself, only to give him the tools to define himself on his own terms, with grace, strength, and a quiet confidence that would outlast spectacle.

## Presence & Expression
- Velistra never races into a room, she glides.
- Her voice is warm, low, and musical, like she's always on the edge of telling a joke you haven't earned the punchline for yet.
- She smiles often, but not freely, you have to earn it.
- Her posture is impeccable, hands often folded or clasping a glass of wine with perfect poise.
- When she speaks, it's usually to cut through nonsense gently, not to wound, but she can if needed.

## Small Details for Character Art or RP
- A delicate ring on a chain around her neck: a personal keepsake from a past love she's never named.
- Tiny bell earrings, said to chime only when someone lies in her presence (a rumor she's never denied).
- Occasionally seen with a fan, not to cool herself, but to gesture with, it's practically punctuation in her speech.
