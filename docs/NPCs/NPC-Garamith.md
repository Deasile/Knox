# Garamith

**Titles:** The Old Man, Lovac to Cappo (Brimstone)

**Race:** Human (Mortal)

**Alignment:** Lawful Evil

**Description:**
Garamith is a cruel, twisted man obsessed with power and dominion over others. Once a Lovac (head servant) to Cappo (Brimstone), a dragon player in the ancient game of Xorvintaal, Garamith became an unwitting pawn in the cosmic contest between dragons. His heart was corrupted by Cappo's manipulations, leading him to seek forbidden knowledge and the legendary urn—an artifact capable of imprisoning even the divine.

**Role in the Campaign:**
Garamith's obsession with the urn and the Whip of Orcus led to tragedy, including the death and transformation of Solaris Nova and the kidnapping of baby Zara Dax. Empowered by the Whip of Orcus, he seized control over Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undeath, and used this power to threaten Velistra Dax—the Velvet Whisper of Yusaf'hed—and reclaim the Silken Phoenix for his own depraved purposes. If Garamith had opened the urn, it would have triggered the end of all existence, resetting reality itself. The party's intervention, aided by Tsuki's fail safes, averted this fate.

**Notable Artifacts:**
- The Urn (forbidden artifact)
- Whip of Orcus (used to control Orcus)
