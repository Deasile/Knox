# Palor

**Titles:** The God of Wishes

**Race:** Deity

**Alignment:** Neutral Good

**Description:**
Palor is the enigmatic god of wishes, capable of granting the deepest desires of mortals and immortals alike. His power is vast but bound by cosmic law and the balance of creation. Palor's essence was once imprisoned within the forbidden urn, making him a target for those seeking ultimate power.

**Role in the Campaign:**
Garamith sought to use Palor's power, in combination with the urn, to control Aurelia and Selene, the Priestesses of the Sun and Moon. In previous iterations, this led to disaster, but in the current timeline, the party freed Palor from the urn, preventing catastrophe and earning his gratitude.
