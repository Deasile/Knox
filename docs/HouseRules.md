# Game Rules & Info (Discord Condensed)

# Fantasy Grounds Setup
- Program: Fantasy Grounds Unity ([link](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/))
- You only need the free version (I have a license)
- Campaign Name: "Knox"
- Password: a

## Character Creation
- Start at level 0
- All stats (Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha, AC, HP) begin at 10 (apply racial bonuses)
- Minimum stat total to graduate: 80
- Maximum stat total: 90
- You will also create a level 1 version of your chosen class
- Race and class are limited to what is available in Fantasy Grounds (ask if you want something not available)

## Inspiration Points
- Everyone starts with 3 Inspiration Points
- 1 = Re-roll anything
- 2 = +1 to roll (can turn a 19 into a Nat 20)
- 3 = +2 to roll (can turn an 18 into a Nat 20)
- 4 = +3 to roll (can turn a 17 into a Nat 20)
- 5 = Nat 20 equivalent

## Old Rules for posterity 
- At the start of each session, you have at least 1 Inspiration Point
- If you have less than 3, you may roll to match/beat the DM's d20 to get up to 3
- Points are for helping the team tell the story use them!

## Setting & Society
- You live in an "ideal" society: no need, no want, no war, no conflict
- All are invited to an elite school for the gifted (young adult/college age for your race)
- Base languages: Common and Common-Coded

## PVP & Social Rules
- Harming others is not part of your society (may change with character development)
- Fun pranks are OK, but:
  - No permanent harm
  - No public/social embarrassment
  - Teasing/pranking friends behind closed doors is OK
  - No preventing character progression

## Year 1: Character Creation & Team Building
- "Class" = activity to gain stats
- Daily schedule: Breakfast (RP/challenge), Morning Class (stat roll), Lunch (RP/challenge), Evening Class (stat roll), Dinner (RP/challenge), Before bed (RP/shenanigans)
- 2 classes per day, 7 per week = 14 stat rolls possible if rushed
- Starting stat points: 60, max cap: 90, minimum to graduate: 78
- Inspiration can always be used to re-roll anything

## Level Progression (Undecided)
- Option 1: 1st Year (0-1), 2nd (1-5), 3rd (5-10), 4th (10-15), 20+ = adventure
- Option 2: 1st Year (0-5), 2nd (5-10), 3rd (10-15), 4th (15-20), 20+ = adventure

## Birthday Wish
- Players get a birthday "wish" for their character (retroactive to session 0 or join date)

## Meta-Gaming & Checks
- If a player says their bonus aloud (e.g., "I have +8 to investigation"), half the bonus is added to the check's difficulty (to discourage meta-gaming)

## Optional Rule: Initiative Swapping
- If player icons are adjacent, you may swap initiative rolls (including bonuses)

## Critical Attacks
Fantasy Grounds handles critical hits perfectly as it is.

Previous homebrew rule (kept for posterity):
- If crit damage is less than max dice roll, add max dice (no bonuses)
- If crit damage is above max, double the total (including bonuses)
