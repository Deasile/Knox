# Seraphia, The Ethereal Kingdom (Story Points)

*Author: Elara Dawn*

Seraphia is a realm born from the ashes of cosmic conflict, where "The First One," a believed-deceased benevolent creator god, orchestrates a quiet resurgence after a clash with the 12 rebellious ancient gods. Across the eons, and veiled from time's grasp, "The First One" clandestinely selects willing individuals from myriad dimensions and realities to populate Seraphia a pocket dimension outside the bounds of conventional time, space, and existence. This pristine sanctuary, shielded from the gaze of the 12 rebellious gods, emerges as a testament to artful curation: a society of elevated beings blissfully unaware of their tumultuous origins, which have been forgotten over the passage of time.

Within this ethereal kingdom, the carefully chosen inhabitants dwell in idyllic harmony, unknowing of the cosmic upheaval that birthed their tranquil abode. The veil of histories past shrouds Seraphia, a realm where peace and serenity reign supreme, preserving the delicate balance crafted by "The First One" in the absence of the 12 rebellious ancient gods' interference. The narrative intertwines divine craftsmanship, cosmic secrets, and the enduring legacy of a creator believed to be lost to time, inviting all to explore a world where beauty and turmoil converge in the creation of exquisite harmony.

## The Golden City
- A pocket dimension created by Tsuki for her first children and their descendants.
- Once a place of perfect harmony, it became the stage for the Betrayal and the Birth of the Gods (1 BoG) - the pivotal event where Sucirdle, envious of Eldricus's adoration, led the Twelve Rebellious Gods in conflict against Eldricus. This Great Battle occurred 2,000 years ago (1300 DR) in the predatorial plane, which translates to two eons in the Golden City (Seraphia), where time flows differently. The aftermath saw the ejection of the city's residents and the beginning of the gods' existence in other realms. This event is referenced as both the Betrayal and the Birth of the Gods throughout campaign lore and marks the start of the BoG calendar (not known to players). The current campaign time is Ninth-day, 19th Mirtul, 1500 DR.


## The Betrayal and the Birth of the Gods (1 BoG)
- Over countless ages before mortals and other realms existed, Sucirdle grew envious and hateful of Eldricus, who was beloved by all in the Golden City.

The resulting conflict known as the Betrayal and the Birth of the Gods culminated in a Great Battle 2,000 years ago (1300 DR) in the prime material plane, which equates to two eons in the Golden City (Seraphia), where time works differently. The aftermath saw the ejection of the city's residents and the gods' emergence into other realms. This event marks the start of the BoG calendar (not known to players) and is referenced throughout campaign lore. The current campaign time is Ninth-day, 19th Mirtul, 1500 DR.
