# The Kingdom of Seraphia


The kingdom of Seraphia is both ancient and futuristic, existing outside of normal time and space. It is separate and unique in its own pocket dimension, which no one other than "The First One" can allow entrance to or exit from. Both the kingdom and the dimension itself are known as Seraphia. Seraphia the dimension was created as the result of a cataclysmic battle between "The First One," a benevolent creator god, and 12 younger but still ancient gods who grew bored of the peace and prosperity "The First One" strove to create. The ensuing battle ripped a hole in existence itself, creating the dimension of Seraphia, which "The First One" then escaped into and sealed behind him, causing the 12 to believe he had been destroyed.

"The First One" spent eons recovering their power and creating Seraphia, the kingdom. Towards the end, they carefully cultivated beings from around all of the rest of existence, making sure not to alert the 12 of their presence. "The First One" made sure to only choose those worthy and willing, cultivating a perfect, peaceful new society composed of the best of the best.

One of the first citizens of Seraphia was the younger god known as Ceridwen, a goddess of wisdom and learning. Her holy library, "The Library of Ascendia," is rumored to contain all of the written, living world's knowledge as well as a great deal beyond that. It is said her thirst for knowledge is never ending, and she continues to seek every morsel of it that she can. Though she cannot directly impact the lives of mortals due to a curse placed on her by the 12, she is still able to grant knowledge through her immense library.

After centuries of growth, evolution, and interspecies mingling, the people of the kingdom of Seraphia physically became almost indistinguishable from typical humans. This process happened slowly over the centuries and is simply how the people are, with no remembrance of their former physical species' differences, though some still have very minor traits like elf descendants having slightly elongated ears or dragon descendants having tiny scales around their eyes.

## Ceridwen - Special Ability: Knowledge Collection

- **Cast Time:** Instant
- **Range:** All Existence. The origin point must be a place where a particular task is intended to take place. If the caster moves 500 feet from the point of origin, the effect ends.
- **Area of Effect:** All Existence
- **Duration:** Special (The effect lasts as long as it takes for task completion but may not extend beyond a typical solar day, which may vary based on activation point, i.e., 24 hours earth time if the focus was a point on earth, 10.7 hours on Saturn, 5,832 hours on Venus)

- Twice per day you can stop time at a godly level. Even unrepaired gods are frozen in time. A god may first make a "perception" check, raw d20 vs raw d20, to see if they are able to perceive the effect before it takes hold, then another raw d20 vs raw d20 "Power Saving Throw."

- A mortal may make a 3d20 roll (difficulty: 1 Nat20 + total roll of 45) to perceive this effect before it takes hold, though there is nothing a mortal can do to avoid this effect.

- You cannot change anything in the frozen world around you, but you can analyze, identify, and gain a deeper understanding of any targets of focus, allowing you to record this information in a special book of "Godly Record," which is then able to be written in one predetermined book within "The Library of Ascendia." While everything is physically frozen, you are able to allow the consciousness of any number of sentient beings to perceive you and your actions during this time.
