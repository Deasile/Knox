## Valen Family Lineage & History
**Origins:**
- Founder: Kaelan Ironheart Valen (human), hero who protected the realm from planar incursions. Married Aeress Ezzie (aasimar) of Excelsior, gate-town to Mount Celestia.
- Torin Wildheart Valen (human): Kaelan’s brother, a daring rogue who explored gate-worlds. Found his mate Zynga Urolo (tiefling). He ignored the Hopeless Gate to Hades, where he was slain and dismembered as a warning.

**Successors:**
- Zahra & Zahira Valen (twins): Sisters who became leaders after Torin’s death. Shifted the role of the Dimension Caretakers from active intervention to observation. Compiled journals on the Outlands, detailing rulers, wars, and events. Created rules for the family:
	- Aid those without a home.
	- Record and preserve knowledge.

**Extended Family (Partial Highlights):**
- Ancestor: Mordenkainen (great x5 grandfather)
- Hazel Gale (The Life Infuser) and Keren Trebilcock (Tender of Universes)
- Verna Lula (The Silver Domain Guide) and Xa’bat Leax
- Constance Belle (The Mysterious Adviser, orc) and Ollie Tristan (The Veiled Custodian, human)
- Many siblings, cousins, and extended relatives of varied races and roles

**Present Day – Milicia Valen:**
- Youngest daughter of the Valen line. Close with her sister Mea.
- Trained under her father and instructors in family duties.
- Lost her mother mysteriously at age five.
- During a refugee festival, their home was attacked. Milicia and Mea defended the children. Milicia failed to stop an enemy strike that killed a refugee boy. Desperate, she prayed to Shaundakul (lesser god of travel, winds, and portals). Her prayer was answered: the boy was revived and healed, though she was left with scars.
- Afterward, Milicia became a traveling paladin of the wind.

**Description:**
A faerie dragon is a cat-sized dragon with butterfly wings. It wears a sharp-toothed grin and expresses its delight by the twitching of its tail, its merriment fading only if it is attacked. The only warning of a faerie dragon's presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon stays out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims contend with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its "prey." A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon's draconic nature by offering it "treasure" in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory. Its scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.
