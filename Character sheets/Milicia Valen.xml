						<desc type="string">Level: 1\nCasting Time: 1 action\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue)\nDuration: 1 round\nRange: Self (15-foot cone)\nA dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can't see).\nStarting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.\n</desc>

You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.\n</desc>

						<desc type="string">Level: 4\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nComponents: V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)\nDuration: 24 hours\nRange: 300 feet\nYou make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.\nThe tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.\n</desc>

						<desc type="string">Level: 0\nCasting Time: 1 action\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nA spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.\nYou can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.\nThe hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.\n</desc>

						<desc type="string">Level: 3\nCasting Time: 1 action\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nRange: 120 feet\nYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.\n</desc>

						<desc type="string">Level: 0\nCasting Time: 1 action\nComponents: S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nYou create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.\nIf you create an image of an object-such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest-it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.\n</desc>

						<desc type="string">Level: 2\nCasting Time: 1 action\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nThree illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.\nEach time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.\nIf you have three duplicates, you must roll a6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.\nA duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it.\nIt ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.\nA creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.\n</desc>

					<id-00008>
						<desc type="string">Level: 4\nCasting Time: 1 action\nComponents: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nRange: 60 feet\nThis spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw. This spell can't affect a target that has 0 hit points.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n</desc>

						<desc type="string">Level: 2\nCasting Time: 1 action\nComponents: V, M (a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours\nRange: 30 feet\nYou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you.\nCreatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable.\nAsking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.\nThe target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.\nIf you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.\n</desc>

							<b>Image: </b>Faerie Dragon</link>
					</linklist>
					<p>A faerie dragon is a cat-sized dragon with butterfly wings. It wears a sharp-toothed grin and expresses its delight by the twitching of its tail, its merriment fading only if it is attacked.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Invisible Tricksters. </i>
						</b>The only warning of a faerie dragon's presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon stays out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims contend with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its &#34;prey.&#34;</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Friendly and Bright. </i>
						</b>A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon's draconic nature by offering it &#34;treasure&#34; in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>The Colors of Age. </i>
						</b>A faerie dragon's scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.</p>

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces.

You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).</p>

					<p>
						<b>Defense</b>

					<p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>

					<p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b>
					</p>
					<p>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
					<p>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
					<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
					<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Spellcasting Ability</b>
					</p>
					<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Spell save DC </b>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
					<p>
						<b>Spell attack modifier </b>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
					<p>
						<b>Spellcasting Focus</b>
					</p>
					<p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>

					<p>Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>
					<p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion.</p>
					<p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Breaking Your Oath</b>
					</p>
					<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>
					<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>
					<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Oath Spells</b>
					</p>
					<p>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
					<p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Channel Divinity</b>
					</p>
					<p>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>
					<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
					<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>

					<p>
						<b>Domain Spells</b>
					</p>
					<p>Each domain has a list of spells-its domain spells-that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>

Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the <i>plane shift </i>spell(save DC 17) ( Useing 6 points of energy) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.&#13;&#13;This items stores 30 points of magical energy to operate.&#13;When empty the cube must be fully powered before it can be used, and can only be refilled when fully empty.&#13;&#13;NOTE: The following 3 spells have been added to the cube in order to help empty the cube if it should not have enough energy to cast Plane Shift or Gate&#13;&#13;Create Bonfire uses 1 Point of stored energy&#13;Tenser's Floating Disk uses 2 points of energy&#13;Find Steed uses 3 points of energy</p>
					<p>&#13;Plane Shift uses 6 Points of stored energy&#13;Gate uses 10 Points of energy&#13;&#13;Side 1 - Keyed to Milicias fathers matching device whereever that may be&#13;Side 2 - Keyed to Mogo neard the only known location of the Mician Village&#13;Side 3 - Keyed - Unknown - Press at you own risk&#13;Side 4 - Keyed - Unknown - Press at you own risk&#13;Side 5 - Keyed - Unknown - Special Condition&#13;Side 6 - Keyed to the pocket dimention one use</p>

					<p>Appearance:</p>
					<p>A palm-sized silver-steel breastplate with a sunburst-shaped coin clasp at the center. It&#8217;s strapped with a small leather harness around his belly, shoulders, and tail. When activated, the armor grows with Tilrum, reshaping into a shining golden draconic chestplate as he enlarges.</p>
					<p>Effects:</p>
					<p>Coin Holster Functionality:</p>
					<p>Tilrum&#8217;s lucky coin is secured in the chest clasp, freeing his claws for smug posing, snack holding, and expressive gestures.</p>
					<p>He can still flip the coin - just with his chin.</p>
					<p>No mechanical protection, but +300% heroic swagger.</p>
					<p>Prideful Puff:</p>
					<p>When Milicia succeeds on a saving throw or crits on an attack and Tilrum is nearby, he lets out a proud chirp and puffs up slightly, as if he did it.</p>
					<p>Enchanted Upgrade &#8211; Golden Rise Transformation:</p>
					<p>Once per long rest, Tilrum may activate the Coinplate&#8217;s latent magic.</p>
					<p>When he does:</p>
					<p>He Enlarges to Large size, or to a size appropriate for Milicia to ride.</p>
					<p>Gains a flying speed of 60 ft if he doesn&#8217;t already have one.</p>
					<p>The transformation lasts for up to 8 hours, or until dismissed (no action required).</p>
					<p>While enlarged, Tilrum is considered a viable flying mount in and out of combat.</p>
					<p>His personality remains the same&#8212;just smugger.</p>
					<p>Flavor Notes:</p>
					<p>When activated, the armor flares with golden shimmer as Tilrum takes flight.</p>
					<p>The embedded coin glows like a second sun.</p>
					<p>His voice doesn&#8217;t get deeper&#8212;but he thinks it does.</p>
					<p>Suggested RP Flair (Optional):</p>
					<p>Insists on being called &#8220;Sir Tilrum the Tall&#8221; while enlarged.</p>
					<p>Sometimes refuses to shrink back until someone praises him. (or time runs out)</p>
					<p>Dramatically guards the party from ridges, trees, or rooftops while refusing to sleep.</p>

					<p>Appearance &#38; Description:&#13;&#13;Made from Darkened mithral plates over red drake scale underlayer</p>
					<p>This masterfully crafted armor blends the lightweight strength of mithral with the supple resilience of red drakehide. Flexible red scales line the joints&#8212;shoulders, underarms, hips, inner thighs, and elbows&#8212;subtly catching the light beneath the dark matte plates. Each panel is shaped with deliberate care: sleek, functional, and devoid of excessive ornamentation.&#13;&#13;Forged by a smith from the City of Wrath, the piece eschews traditional infernal flair for a controlled, disciplined design. A small stylized sigil representing Wrath&#8212;not as rage, but as willful resolve&#8212;is engraved into the belt buckle and the base of the gorget.&#13;&#13;The armor hums faintly with dormant energy&#8212;heat coiled in stillness, like a warrior waiting for the moment to act.&#13;&#13;Mantle of the Crimson Vow (Passive &#38; Reaction)&#13;&#13;When Milicia is struck by a critical hit, the armor flares with suppressed draconic heat. The attacker takes 1d8 fire damage.&#13;&#13;Once per long rest, Milicia may reroll a failed saving throw against being charmed or frightened (no reaction required). The second roll is made with advantage.&#13;&#13;Voice of Iron (Bonus Action, 1/short rest)&#13;&#13;For a number of rounds equal to proficiency +1, Milicia invokes the armor's latent wrathful resonance.&#13;&#13;Allies within 10 ft gain +1 AC while in range.&#13;&#13;Milicia gains resistance to psychic damage and cannot be disarmed.&#13;&#13;Hellforged Stealthcraft (Passive)&#13;&#13;No disadvantage on Stealth.&#13;&#13;Gains advantage on Stealth checks in dim light or after standing still for 1 round, as the drake scales dull reflection and absorb ambient light.</p>
					<p>Optional Lore Hook:</p>
					<p>&#8220;Crafted in the City of Wrath for a warrior who embodies control over fury, not surrender to it. The artisan who forged it is known for rejecting the chaos of infernal tradition in favor of discipline and honor. This armor is not a weapon&#8212;it is a vow.&#8221;</p>

					<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).</p>
					<p>Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.</p>
					<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>
