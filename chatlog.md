## Lessons Learned & Change Log (2025-09-01)

### What Has Worked

### What Has Not Worked

### SOP Updates

## Summary of What Has Worked

### 1. Inline Style-Driven HTML

### 2. Color Combinations for Readability on Dark Backgrounds

#### Top-Rated Combos
  - Stylish, magical, highly readable. Great for fantasy/arcane themes.
  - Magical/royal, works well for fantasy or treasure themes.
  - Energetic, warm, good for highlights or callouts.
  - Energetic, readable, good for magical or nature themes.
  - Cool, modern, readable. Good for water, sky, or arcane themes.

#### Other Good Combos
  - Classic, readable, energetic. Good for warnings or strong emphasis.
  - Sci-fi or arcane feel, readable but less warm.

#### Neutral/Acceptable Combos
  - Maximum contrast, but generic and less thematic.
  - Clean, readable, but less vibrant or thematic.

#### Combos That Did Not Work Well
  - Playful and magical, but hard to read or too intense for large sections. Best for highlights only.

### 3. Multi-Color/Elaborate Styling (In Progress)

## What Hasn’t Worked

## Next Steps
## [2025-09-01] SOP Refactor Automation
- Created branch `sop-refactor-automation` for workflow and documentation improvements.
- Added VS Code task for SOP verification checklist.
- Provided HTML and CSS code snippets for SOP compliance.
- Added batch script and README for template automation.
- Lessons Learned: Windows PowerShell does not expand %APPDATA% in copy commands as expected; manual copy of snippets to `%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets\` is required for integration.
- Next: Continue documentation updates and refactoring in new branch.


This log documents all style and color experiments, ratings, and decisions for future reference. For detailed color codes and ratings, see GoodStyles.md.

## Change Log Entry (2025-09-01)

- Operation: Update Character Page SOP (Footer)
- Result: Success
- Method: SOP for character-specific pages now requires the exact footer structure and styles from index.html. Footer must be visually verified for consistency and readability. All changes and lessons learned recorded in chatlog.md and SOP.md.

Next: Refactor character page footers to match index.html.
