### Major Milestones & Actions

- Migrated D&D campaign reference from MkDocs/Markdown to a static HTML/CSS/JS site.
- Created a modern, modular directory structure: `html/`, `css/`, `js/`, `assets/images/`.
- Set up a local development server for live preview and troubleshooting.
- Designed a card-based character grid with images and links to individual detail pages.
- Created and iteratively refined detail pages for each main character: Biggus Menethil, Milicia Valen, Feren Dax, and Yo.
- Ensured all images are in `assets/images/` and referenced correctly from all HTML files.
- Added navigation and consistent styling across all pages.
- Added detailed lore, magic items, companions, and story notes for each character, with special attention to Milicia and Feren Dax.
- Linked to external resources (Forgotten Realms wiki) for deities and patrons.
- Cleaned up the repository: removed all legacy, Markdown, and unused files/folders, keeping only the static site and config/environment files.
- Automated the process for cleaning, moving, and publishing the site to both `main` and `gh-pages` branches.
- Forced the local state to overwrite the remote `gh-pages` branch, ensuring the live site matches the local project exactly.
- Updated all footers to include: `© 2025 D&D Campaign Reference — Ruleset: D&D 5e (2014 version)`.
- Responded to all user requests for content, layout, and repo management, including PowerShell automation scripts.

### Detailed Timeline & Key Decisions

1. **Initial Migration & Setup**
   - User requested a move from MkDocs/Markdown to a static HTML/CSS/JS site for greater flexibility and visual control.
   - Scaffolded a new project structure, created main folders, and set up a Python HTTP server for local testing.

2. **Character Page Development**
   - Designed a 2x2 grid of character cards using CSS flexbox.
   - Ensured each card links to a dedicated detail page for that character.
   - Fixed image paths and ensured all images display correctly.
   - Made the entire card clickable, not just the name or text.
   - Updated CSS to remove default link styling from cards.

3. **Detail Page Content**
   - Created and filled out detail pages for Biggus, Milicia, Feren Dax, and Yo.
   - Added all available character info, including:
     - Backstory, notable abilities, patron/deity, story moments, magic items, companions, family history, and cultural notes.
   - Linked to external lore (Forgotten Realms wiki) for deities and patrons.
   - Updated Biggus's page to show N/A for Backstory, Patron/Deity, and Story Moments as requested.

4. **Repository Cleanup & Publishing**
   - Identified and removed all legacy/unused files and folders (Markdown, old builds, Notion/MkDocs imports, etc.).
   - Ensured only `html/`, `css/`, `js/`, `assets/`, and config/environment files remain.
   - Automated the process for moving, cleaning, and publishing the site to both `main` and `gh-pages` branches.
   - Used `git push --force` to ensure the remote `gh-pages` branch matches the local project exactly.
   - Verified that all images are in `assets/images/` and pushed to the repo.

5. **Final Touches**
   - Updated all page footers to include the ruleset and copyright.
   - Provided PowerShell scripts and step-by-step instructions for all repo management tasks.
   - Ensured the live GitHub Pages site is always in sync with the local project.

### Notable Technical Details

- All navigation and asset paths are relative and compatible with both local and GitHub Pages hosting.
- All character images are in `assets/images/` and referenced with correct relative paths from HTML files.
- The site is fully modular: new characters or pages can be added by copying and editing existing HTML files.
- All CSS and JS are in their respective folders and loaded via `<link>` and `<script>` tags.
- The repo is now clean, modern, and easy to maintain or expand.

### Outstanding/Optional Tasks

- Add a favicon to `assets/icons/favicon.ico` for a custom browser tab icon.
- Add more lore, NPCs, or campaign notes as the campaign evolves.
- Consider adding a README.md with instructions for future maintainers.
- Optionally, automate deployment to `gh-pages` with a CI/CD workflow.
