# Notion Import Instructions

## 1. Prepare Your Files
- Ensure all your Markdown files (Characters.md, Locations.md, etc.) and images are in a single folder.
- Download all images from your `docs/images/` folder to your computer.
- Place the images in a subfolder called `images` in the same directory as your Markdown files.

## 2. Import to Notion
- In Notion, create a new page for your campaign.
- Click the three dots (•••) in the top-right, then select **Import**.
- Choose **Markdown & CSV**.
- Select the folder containing your Markdown files and the `images` subfolder.
- Notion will create a page for each Markdown file.

## 3. Fix Image Links
- After import, go to each page with images.
- Click the image placeholder, then upload the corresponding image from your `images` folder.
- Notion will embed the image directly.

## 4. Organize Pages
- Drag and drop pages in Notion to create a sidebar structure similar to your MkDocs navigation.
- You can create subpages, add icons/covers, and use Notion's database features for advanced organization.

## 5. (Optional) Enhance with Notion Features
- Add tables, toggles, callouts, and more for a richer experience.
- Use Notion's backlinks and database relations for cross-referencing characters, locations, and lore.
