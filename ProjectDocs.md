# Project Documentation Structure Proposal

## Purpose
To improve maintainability, clarity, and efficiency, project documentation will be restructured into dedicated files by scope. This enables targeted updates, easier navigation, and better collaboration.

   - User Feedback & Requests
   - Summary of Actions

2. **SoP.md**
   - General SOPs
   - Character Page SOPs
   - Footer/Header/Main SOPs
   - Collaboration & Verification SOPs

3. **Verification.md**
   - Visual and technical verification steps/results
   - Checklist for SOP compliance
   - Reports from manual/AI agents

4. **DesignStandards.md**
   - Color schemes
   - Layout templates
   - Accessibility rules
   - Example code snippets

5. **Workflow.md**
   - Step-by-step workflow for refactoring, updating, and verifying pages
   - Roles and responsibilities
   - Collaboration process

6. **LessonsLearned.md**
   - Running log of lessons, failures, and fixes
   - Rationale for major decisions
