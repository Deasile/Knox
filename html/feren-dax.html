    <h2>Backstory</h2>
  <p>Feren Dax is a Tiefling Hexblade Warlock of <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Alobal_Lorfiril" target="_blank">Alobal</a>, born in Yusaf’hed, the city of pride and pleasure. Raised in the Silken Phoenix, a palace-brothel managed by his mother Velistra Dax, Feren received rigorous training in etiquette, swordplay, and politics. His best friend and sparring partner is Torri Spellguard. Feren’s true magical calling awakened alone, outside the influence of the Phoenix, through the mysterious deity <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Alobal_Lorfiril" target="_blank">Alobal</a>. He leaves Yusaf’hed as an adult, returning annually for brief visits. Feren presents as charming and elegant but is internally conflicted about his legacy and home. Birthday: Mirtul 8th.</p>

    <h2>Magic Items</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single-Use Featherfall Ring:</strong> Allows a one-time use of the Featherfall spell.</li>
      <li><strong>Weapon Focus Feature:</strong> As a special action, using this weapon as a focus grants an additional Eldritch Blast.</li>
      <li><strong>Ring of Parallel Minds:</strong> Silver ring with two parallel, glowing gemstones. Lets an attuned Warlock (level 7+, with at least one 4th-level spell) concentrate on two spells at once. <br>
        <em>Drawbacks:</em>
        <ul>
          <li>While concentrating on two spells, must make a DC 15 Constitution save at the start of each turn.</li>
          <li>On failure, roll 1d6 (or DM chooses) for magical mishaps (backlash, surge, confusion, exhaustion, spell lockout, etc).</li>
          <li>Any effect that would disrupt concentration has a 20% chance to trigger a magical resonance effect.</li>
        </ul>
        <em>Restrictions:</em> Only for concentration spells. Only attunable by qualifying Warlocks. DM determines exact resonance effects for added unpredictability.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Rod of Absorption:</strong> Stores spell slots (1st level = 1 slot).</li>
      <li><strong>Solaris’ Lucky Coin:</strong> Grants one “perfect roll” (Nat 20 or max attack hit/damage). After use, becomes a regular gold coin (1gp).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Family & Key Relationships</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Velistra Dax (“The Velvet Whisper of Yusaf’hed”):</strong> Matron and mistress of the Silken Phoenix. Commands respect through presence and principle, not cruelty. Teaches Feren not everyone who seeks your fire deserves to hold it. <br>
        <em>Details for RP/Art:</em> Never rushes, glides into rooms. Warm, low musical voice; smiles must be earned. Impeccable posture, graceful gestures. Wears a keepsake ring on a chain, tiny bell earrings, sometimes carries a fan. Shadow flickers when alone (hinting at an old infernal pact).</li>
      <li><strong>Torri Spellguard (“The Magebreaker of Yusaf’hed”):</strong> Daughter of a seamstress at the Silken Phoenix. Quiet, earnest, and unassuming; magic recoils from her presence. Supported and mentored by Velistra, trained with Feren. Prefers utility over recognition, now a humble pillar of the city guard. Known for neutralizing magic (“Magebreaker”). Maintains a close friendship with Feren, always greeting him first on his return, providing support without fanfare.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Magical Companion: Mika</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Type:</strong> Celestial (Tiny)</li>
      <li><strong>Ancient Magic Fortitude:</strong> If Mika is reduced to 0 hit points (not by a critical hit), she can make a Constitution saving throw (DC = damage taken − 5). On a success, she drops to 1 hit point instead. If she still drops to 0, she disappears until after a long rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Cute Overload:</strong> Mika’s cuteness overwhelms those around her, granting Feren +5 Charisma if within 10 feet of Mika.</li>
      <li><strong>Healer’s Light (1/long rest):</strong> Mika chooses a creature within 15 feet and flares with invigorating light. The target gains 1d8 + Proficiency Bonus temporary hit points.</li>
      <li>If Mika is reduced to 0 hit points: She disappears until after a long rest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Familiar: Hime (“Princess”)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Small, three-tailed white fox spirit with blue-tipped ears and tails, wears a dark rose ribbon with a golden bell.</li>
      <li>Eyes: Deep amber flecked with gold.</li>
      <li>Personality: Quietly proud, communicates telepathically with a regal, commanding tone.</li>
      <li>Not a pet, but a familiar chosen through mutual bond with Feren.</li>
      <li>Cannot be truly killed; spirit returns to the ethereal planes if physical form is destroyed.</li>
      <li>Symbolizes Feren’s self-determined path and struggles with immortality.</li>
      <li>Personal note: Can be difficult if denied her wishes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setting & Lore</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Silken Phoenix:</strong> Establishment run by Velistra Dax in Yusaf’hed. Sanctuary of refinement; suitors must be deemed worthy. Center of etiquette, politics, and social maneuvering.</li>
      <li><strong>City of Yusaf’hed:</strong> Capital of pride and pleasure; reputation and legacy are paramount. Known as the City of Sun and Moon (Palace = Sol, Temple = Luna). Feren, Milicia, and Yo are heading to the temple. Biggus encountered a Micean (dragon/human overlay, appears as dark-skinned humanoid). Party is temporally displaced, currently 1500+ years in the past.</li>
      <li><strong>The Golden City (Story from “The Golden City By The Oracle”):</strong> Exists beyond time, bathed in eternal light.
