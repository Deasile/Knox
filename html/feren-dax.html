Raised in the Silken Phoenix, a palace-brothel managed by his mother Velistra Dax, Feren received rigorous training in etiquette, swordplay, and politics. His best friend and sparring partner is Torri Spellguard. Feren's true magical calling awakened alone, outside the influence of the Phoenix, through the mysterious deity Alobal.

      <h2>Companions</h2>
      <h3>Magical Companion: Mika</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Celestial (Tiny)</li>
        <li><strong>Ancient Magic Fortitude:</strong> If Mika is reduced to 0 hit points (not by a critical hit), she can make a Constitution saving throw (DC = damage taken − 5). On a success, she drops to 1 hit point instead. If she still drops to 0, she disappears until after a long rest.</li>
        <li><strong>Cute Overload:</strong> Mika’s cuteness overwhelms those around her, granting Feren +5 Charisma if within 10 feet of Mika.</li>
        <li><strong>Healer’s Light (1/long rest):</strong> Mika chooses a creature within 15 feet and flares with invigorating light. The target gains 1d8 + Proficiency Bonus temporary hit points.</li>
        <li>If Mika is reduced to 0 hit points: She disappears until after a long rest.</li>

      <h2>Family & Key Relationships</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Velistra Dax (“The Velvet Whisper of Yusaf’hed”):</strong> Matron and mistress of the Silken Phoenix. Commands respect through presence and principle, not cruelty. Teaches Feren not everyone who seeks your fire deserves to hold it. Never rushes, glides into rooms. Warm, low musical voice; smiles must be earned. Impeccable posture, graceful gestures. Wears a keepsake ring on a chain, tiny bell earrings, sometimes carries a fan. Shadow flickers when alone (hinting at an old infernal pact).</li>
        <li><strong>Torri Spellguard (“The Magebreaker of Yusaf’hed”):</strong> Daughter of a seamstress at the Silken Phoenix. Quiet, earnest, and unassuming; magic recoils from her presence. Supported and mentored by Velistra, trained with Feren. Prefers utility over recognition, now a humble pillar of the city guard. Known for neutralizing magic (“Magebreaker”). Maintains a close friendship with Feren, always greeting him first on his return, providing support without fanfare.</li>
        <li><strong>Zara Dax (sister):</strong> Supportive and clever</li>
        <li><strong>Cyndara Crossfire (ex-girlfriend):</strong> Friend and ally</li>
