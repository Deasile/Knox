    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>Milicia Valen is a Half-Orc torn between two worlds: the discipline and faith of a Paladin and the raw power and tradition of her orcish heritage. As a Gate Warden, she is responsible for protecting the boundaries between realms and ensuring the safety of travelers. Her dual devotion to Shaundakul and Gruumsh gives her a unique perspective, balancing mercy with might. Milicia is fiercely protective of her friends and will go to great lengths to uphold her oaths.</p>

    <h2>Valen Family Lineage & History</h2>
    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Founder:</strong> Kaelan Ironheart Valen (human), hero who protected the realm from planar incursions. Married Aeress Ezzie (aasimar) of Excelsior, gate-town to Mount Celestia.</li>
      <li><strong>Torin Wildheart Valen (human):</strong> Kaelan’s brother, a daring rogue who explored gate-worlds. Found his mate Zynga Urolo (tiefling). He ignored the Hopeless Gate to Hades, where he was slain and dismembered as a warning.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Successors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Zahra & Zahira Valen (twins):</strong> Sisters who became leaders after Torin’s death. Shifted the role of the Dimension Caretakers from active intervention to observation. Compiled journals on the Outlands, detailing rulers, wars, and events. Created rules for the family:
        <ul>
          <li>Aid those without a home.</li>
          <li>Record and preserve knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Extended Family (Partial Highlights)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ancestor: Mordenkainen (great x5 grandfather)</li>
      <li>Hazel Gale (The Life Infuser) and Keren Trebilcock (Tender of Universes)</li>
      <li>Verna Lula (The Silver Domain Guide) and Xa’bat Leax</li>
      <li>Constance Belle (The Mysterious Adviser, orc) and Ollie Tristan (The Veiled Custodian, human)</li>
      <li>Many siblings, cousins, and extended relatives of varied races and roles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Present Day – Milicia Valen</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Youngest daughter of the Valen line. Close with her sister Mea.</li>
      <li>Trained under her father and instructors in family duties.</li>
      <li>Lost her mother mysteriously at age five.</li>
      <li>During a refugee festival, their home was attacked. Melicia and Mea defended the children. Melicia failed to stop an enemy strike that killed a refugee boy. Desperate, she prayed to Shaundakul (lesser god of travel, winds, and portals). Her prayer was answered: the boy was revived and healed, though she was left with scars.</li>
      <li>Afterward, Melicia became a traveling paladin of the wind.</li>
