## The Loom of Souls (Mogo)
The Loom of Souls is the land of the dead on the living god-planet Mogo. Here, souls are cleansed and prepared for rebirth, their memories and experiences woven back into the fabric of existence. The party first met Feren Dax in this realm, which is central to the campaign's cosmic cycle and fate.
