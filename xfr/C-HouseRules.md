# Compiled: House Rules

## House Rules

1. **Initiative Swapping**: As a group of adventurers who have traveled together for some time, you are able to intelligently and tactically arrange your turn order among yourselves at the start of combat.

2. **Birthday Wish**: Birthday wishes are special (at the DM's discretion). Mechanically, this means you may receive a boon or an uncommon-quality item, uniquely flavored to suit your character.

- Other house rules: MTG packs, special abilities, and mechanics (see campaign notes for details).

## Cultural Lore
- The Signet Code (Miliciaâ€™s culture)
