# Standardized Character HTML Format

## Strict Compliance Rule

All character HTML files must strictly comply with this format. Any information not present in this ruleset must be deleted from the HTML file. However, before deletion, all such information must be saved in a separate file named after the character, with the suffix _deleted (e.g., milicia-valen_deleted.txt), for archival and reference purposes. This rule takes precedence over all others.
