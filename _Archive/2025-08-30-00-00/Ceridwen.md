## Special Ability: Knowledge Collection

- **Cast Time:** Instant
- **Range:** All Existence. The origin point must be a place where a particular task is intended to take place. If the caster moves 500 feet from the point of origin, the effect ends.
- **Area of Effect:** All Existence
- **Duration:** Special (The effect lasts as long as it takes for task completion but may not extend beyond a typical solar day, which may vary based on activation point, i.e., 24 hours earth time if the focus was a point on earth, 10.7 hours on Saturn, 5,832 hours on Venus)

- Twice per day you can stop time at a godly level. Even unrepaired gods are frozen in time. A god may first make a “perception” check, raw d20 vs raw d20, to see if they are able to perceive the effect before it takes hold, then another raw d20 vs raw d20 “Power Saving Throw.”

- A mortal may make a 3d20 roll (difficulty: 1 Nat20 + total roll of 45) to perceive this effect before it takes hold, though there is nothing a mortal can do to avoid this effect.

- You cannot change anything in the frozen world around you, but you can analyze, identify, and gain a deeper understanding of any targets of focus, allowing you to record this information in a special book of “Godly Record,” which is then able to be written in one predetermined book within “The Library of Ascendia.” While everything is physically frozen, you are able to allow the consciousness of any number of sentient beings to perceive you and your actions during this time.
